## Why should I think about performance?

It's a feature in your app that you should have on your mind all the time:

- Responsiveness delights and engages users
- Be a good neighbor, especially in Multitasking on iPad
- Efficient apps extend battery life
- Supports the whole range of iOS 9 hardware

## Thinking About Performance

- Choosing technologies
  - Know the technologies
  - Pick the best ones for your app
  - Apple technologies are optimized (we use them)
  - Benifit from updating

- Taking measurements
  - Animations: Instruments: Core Animation
  - Responsiveness: Core instrumentation, Instruments: System Trace
        - Don't ship your instrumentation: Create a copy of release scheme in Xcode, and define one additional define, so you could build a release version of the app with performance instrumentation quickly and easily.
        - Collect start and end times: CFAbsoluteTimeGetCurrent
        - Taps and button presses: IBAction, touchesEnded, UIGestureRecognizer target
        - Tabs and modal views: viewWillAppear, viewDidAppear, will show how long it takes to display a the view.

  - Memory: Xcode debugger, Instruments Allocations, Instruments Leaks
    - Allocate, Reallocate memory takes time.

- Setting goals
  - 60fps scrolling and animations. 
  - Respond to user actiosn in 100ms

- Performance Workflow
  - Reproduce -> Profil -> Measure -> Change code -> Reproduce

  - Profiling vs Measuring
    - Profiling: Unsderstanding overall app activity
      - Xcode debugger
      - Instruments: Time Profiler

-  
  -  
    - Measuring: Instrumenting a specific action
      - CGAbsoluteTimeGetCurrent
      - Instruments: System Trace

-  
  - Avoid Using the Main Thread for
    - CPU-intensive work
    - Tasks that depend on external resource

-  
  - Common Blocking Calls
    - Any code path that ends up making a syscall
    - Accessing resources not currently in memory: Disk I/O, Network access
    - Waiting for work to complete on another thread

-  
  -  
    - Networking: `NSURLConnection` and friends
      - Use asynchronous API
      - Use GCD, Ref: Building Responsive and Efficient Apps with GCD 
      - `NSURLSession` background session

-  
  -  
    - Foundation initializers
      - contentsOfFile:
      - contentsOfURL:

    - Core Data
      - Move some Core Data work to different concurrency modes. Ref: What's New in Core Data, Mission.
