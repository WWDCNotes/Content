## Low Latency Core Animation

- The Core animation work starts as soon as the app commits, no need to wait for the next frame to come first
- Done automatically from iOS 9, no extra logic necessary
- Disabled for animations (`CAAnimation`s and `UIView`'s animations)
- Works also with [`CAEAGLLayer`][CAEAGLLayer] and [`CAMetalLayer`][CAMetalLayer], in this case you can use [`presentsWithTransaction`][presentsWithTransaction] to make sure your metal layer is in sync with your Core Animation layer (otherwise it might happen that the metal layer renders before)

## Touch Coalescing

From the iPad Air 2, iOS devices ship with a 120-hertz touch scan update rate, this means that devices get twice as much touch events for example when dragging/drawing.

iOS will still deliver new touch events at the beginning of a new frame, however you will have access to possibly two touch events instead of just one.

To get those touches, there's a new API: `UIEvent`'s [`coalescedTouches(for:)`][coalescedTouches(for:)], which returns an array of all the coalesced touches since the last time iOS delivered that touch to your app.

Usage example, from:

```swift
for touch in touches {
  let line = lineForTouch(touch)
  addTouchSample(touch, toLine: line)
}
```

to:

```swift
for touch in touches {
  let line = lineForTouch(touch)
  for coalescedTouch in event.coalescedTouchesForTouch(touch) {
    addTouchSample(coalescedTouch, toLine: line)
  }
}
```

## Touch Prediction

Use this API to get even lower latency in your apps.

How it works:

- iOS looks at the touches that are delivered to your app, and uses a set of highly tuned algorithms to determine where the user's finger looks like it's going at this time
- And as we get new touch samples, we will update our prediction and deliver new predicted touches to your app

New `UIEvent` API: [`predictedTouches(for:)`][predictedTouches(for:)]

Usage example:

```swift
for touch in touches {
  // Like before
  let line = lineForTouch(touch)
  for coalescedTouch in event.coalescedTouchesForTouch(touch) {
    addTouchSample(coalescedTouch, toLine: line)
  }

  // Remove old predicted touches
  removePredictedSamplesFromLine(line)

  // Add new predicted touches
  for predictedTouch in event.predictedTouchesForTouch(touch) {
    addPredictedTouchSample(predictedTouch, toLine: line)
  }
}
```
