## Design information flow

Truth vs. derived values: 

- Where is truth? 
- Who really knows that state which one place should be consulted for it?
- Values derived from truth are in many ways like a cache and needed to be treated as such

## Define clear responsibilities

- Think of the inputs and outputs
- Separate out responsibilities from the rest of the program
- Use composition to build up larger pieces from smaller ones

Example: validators.

```swift
protocol Validator {
  validateWithError(error: NSErrorPointer) -> Bool
}
```

- Definition of “input” left open to interpretation

For example: 

```swift
class SignUpValidator: Validator {
  let usernameValidator = UsernameValidator()
  let setPasswordValidator = SetPasswordValidator()
  let emailAddressValidator = EmailAddressValidator()
  ...
}
```

## Simplify with immutability

Use Swift structs to avoid having objects changing data they're not supposed to change.
