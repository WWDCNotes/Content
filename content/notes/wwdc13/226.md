## Custom UIViewController transitions

- Create and Initialize new UIViewController
- Set `transitioningDelegate` to be `self`
- Set `modalPresentationStyle` to be `UIModalPresentationCustom`
- Call `- presentViewController:animated:completion:`
- In this UIViewController, conforms to `UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate`
- Implement `- (id <UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning>) animationControllerForPresentedController:(UIViewController *)presented presentingController:(UIViewController *)presenting sourceController:(UIViewController *)source` delegate method. In this method, we could totally customize the return object which conforms to `UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning`. This delegate method give custom transition when trying to present a new `UIViewController`.
- Implement `- (id <UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning>)animationControllerForDismissedController:(UIViewController *)dismissed`, In this method, we could also totally customize the return object which conforms to `UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning`. This delegate method give custom transition when trying to dismiss a presented `UIViewController`.
- Create a custom subclass of NSObject conforms to `UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning`, override several required methods, then magic happens.

## App-wide appearance

`UIAppearance` is very useful `Protocol` in iOS system. Developer could use this protocol to customize all the UIView or UIControl in one action.
Example is like: `[[UIButton appearance] setTintColor:[UIColor redColor]]`

## Resizable and template images

`- [UIImage resizableImageWithCapInsets:]`

## UIKit Dynamics

The basics:

```objc
animator = [[UIDynamicAnimator alloc] initWithReferenceView:self.view];

gravityBehavior = [[UIGravityBehavior alloc] initWithItems:@[itemToAnimate]];

[animator addBehavior:gravityBehavior];
```
