## Text Effects (iOS 7)
We can obtain many text effects via the attribute (of a `NSAttrributedString`) NSTextEffectAttributeName. 

> Just checked: it’s 2018 (5 years later) and the only effect is still just `NSAttributedString.TextEffectStyle.letterpressStyle` 

## The Trio 

In TextKit, there are three classes that are used to represent the text in the app and turn it into glyphs which users will see on screen.

### NSTextStorage 

- Provides the backing store for the text in the app.  
- It’s a `NSMutableAttributedString` subclass: it controls the text unicode characters, attributes etc

### NSLayoutManager 

- Manages how that text gets turned into glyphs and has customizable override points.  
- It takes the given text (from `NSTextStorage`) and translates it into glyphs on screen.  
- (Via delegation) We can accomplish advanced layout techniques such as folding lines or other advanced text rendering.

### NSTextContainer 

- Describes the geometry about which the flow lines and line fragments in your text view.  
- Represents one area on the display in which you'd like to draw a text.

What is a text container?

A text container defines a coordinate system and geometry for an `NSLayoutManager`.

Exclusion paths live entirely in the `NSTextContainer`'s coordinate space.

Hit-testing is also done in the `NSTextContainer`'s coordinate space.  
Hit testing returns the glyph that was tapped:

Above: Three characters, one glyph.

Note: one glyph is not a one-to-one mapping from a glyph to a set of characters or vice-versa.

Therefore we need to use the `NSLayoutManager` conversion:

This works chars to glyphs, too.

One `NSLayoutManager` can have multiple `NSTextContainer`, this is how we get multipage and multi column support almost for free.

With `NSLayoutManager` we can:

- get the exact position and `sizeof` each single character 😍 (more precisely, of the glyph, which is font + character) and line
- Modifying line spacing
- Validating soft line breaking
- Custom glyph mapping
