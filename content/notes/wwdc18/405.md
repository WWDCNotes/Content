Signposts - a new feature of the [`os_log`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/logging) API

- useful for debugging performance issues
- integrated with Instruments, which can visualize activity over time using signposts

Signposts allow you to mark the beginning and end of a piece of work and mark it with some kind of label:

```swift
import os.signpost

let refreshLog = OSLog(subsystem: "…", category: "…")

os_signpost(.begin, log: refreshLog, name: "Fetch Asset")
// …do actual work…
os_signpost(.end, log: refreshLog, name: "Fetch Asset")
```

Ranges of signposts with different names can overlap - e.g. you can have one signpost covering the whole process and smaller signposts covering specific single tasks that it consists of:

```swift
os_signpost(.begin, log: log, name: "Load Data")

os_signpost(.begin, log: log, name: "Fetch Asset")
// …
os_signpost(.end, log: log, name: "Fetch Asset")

os_signpost(.begin, log: log, name: "Parse JSON")
// …
os_signpost(.end, log: log, name: "Parse JSON")

os_signpost(.end, log: log, name: "Load Data")
```

If you run multiple tasks of the same kind, to let the system differentiate between them and know which begin matches which end, you can add a “signpost ID”:

```swift
os_signpost(.begin, log: log, name: "Load Data")

for asset in assets {
    let spid = OSSignpostID(log: log)

    os_signpost(.begin, log: refreshLog, name: "Fetch Asset", signpostID: spid)
    // …do actual work…
    os_signpost(.end, log: refreshLog, name: "Fetch Asset", signpostID: spid)
}

os_signpost(.end, log: log, name: "Load Data")
```

You can also pass your model object when generating the signpost ID - then it will always use the same signpost ID for the same object, and you don't have to store the signpost object, just your model:

```swift
let spid = OSSignpostID(log: log, object: asset)
```

There is also an option of passing an additional string argument to begin/end to provide some context (e.g. to differentiate between different possible ways to finish an activity, like success/failure). The string also accepts format arguments like `os_log`:

```swift
os_signpost(.begin, log: log, name: "Compute Physics",
    "Calculating %{public}s: %d %d %d %d", description, x1, y2, x2, y2)
```

Apart from marking the beginning and end, you can also mark specific points in time during the process using the `.event` signpost type:

```swift
os_signpost(.event, log: log, name: "Fetch Asset",
    "Received chunk of data, size %d", size)
```

Signposts are very optimized internally, they’re built to minimize the time spent when logging, same as the whole `os_log` API. This means you can emit a lot of signposts even in a very tight window when investigating a performance bottleneck.

If you still really want to enable or disable some signpost logs based on some conditions, you can swap your logger object with [`OSLog.disabled`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/oslog/2863695-disabled):

```swift
let refreshLog: OSLog

if ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment.keys.contains("SIGNPOSTS_REFRESH") {
    refreshLog = OSLog(…)
} else {
    refreshLog = .disabled
}
```

To conditionally disable some expensive code that is only useful for debugging, you can check the [`signpostsEnabled`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/oslog/3006881-signpostsenabled) property:

```swift
if refreshLog.signpostsEnabled {
    let information = collectInfo()
    os_signpost(…, information)
}
```

All APIs are also available in C & ObjC:

```objc
#include <os/signpost.h>

os_signpost_interval_begin()
os_signpost_interval_end()
os_signpost_event_emit()
os_signpost_id_t
OS_LOG_DISABLED
```

Use the formatter `%{xcode:size-in-bytes}u` to let Xcode & Instruments know that the logged value is a byte size of some data

- This is one of so called “Engineering types” - find more in the Instruments Help menu, in the Instruments developer guide


## Instruments tips

- Use the “os_signpost” instrument to profile using signposts
- After recording some data, you can see the signpost names in the sidebar on the left and signpost ranges with the optional begin/end comments marked on the chart
- In the bottom pane you can see count and duration statistics, grouped by category, signpost, id and comment
- Clicking the arrow button next to a specific message row shows you a list of all instances of this specific message (selecting them highlights them on the timeline)
- For metadata like logged byte sizes of downloads, you can choose “Summary: Metadata Statistics” to see total/min/max/avg of each type of value
- Live streaming signpost logs to Instruments (“Immediate mode”) adds some overhead, so if you want to avoid that while debugging some performance-critical code, click and hold the Record button to access recording options and change mode to “Last n seconds”


## Points of interest

Points of interest is a special log category of `OSLog`. It’s meant for logging important actions taken by the user, like opening some specific screen.

Normal `os_log` logs and signpost logs logged to this category appear in a special separate Instruments timeline, which lets you visualize what was happening in the app at the moment when something happened on other charts like CPU usage.


## Custom Instruments packages

You can now build your custom Instruments packages, defined as an XML file in a separate target, which appear as a new kind of template when starting Instruments. This lets you process and present collected signpost data in a different way that makes sense for the specific problem you’re analyzing.
