## Common Sense

The first part of the session is a recap of the other [notification][wwdc18710] [sessions][wwdc18711] with some extra common sense such as:

- when it is ok for an app to deliver quiet notifications, therefore without prompting the user for the notification authorization and the likes.
- Notifications should provide content and value to the user
- Notifications are not reasons to open your app (stop.spamming.)

## Rich notifications and Apple Watch

- Some features of our notifications are automatically translated to an Apple Watch notification for free, for example:
  - Image attachment
  - Notification title
  - Notification body
  - And quick actions
  - Ways we can customize the notification:
    - default:
      ![][1Image]
    - with customization:
      ![][2Image]

- 
  - Sash color (the light blue strip on the app name)
  - Background color (the background blur has customizable tint) 
  - Add in-line images/icons/videos

- (New in watchOS 5) Interactive notifications (like iOS 12), available if you have a watch app
