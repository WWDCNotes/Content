- Use Formatters
- Use storyboards with auto layout
- Use `UIStackViews` and `UICollectionViews` as much as possible
- When designing constraints, think about:
  - text that can be much shorter/longer
  - Directionality (right to left languages)

- After opening a `.storyboard` file, open the assistant editor (`cmd`+`opt`+`enter`), select the `storyboard (preview)` option and now at the bottom right you can preview your view in different languages without the need to run the app:

- How to check if a font supports a certain language? In every mac there’s a tool called `Font Book` where you can search by language and it displays all the (installed) fonts that support that language.
- Very much like on `.css` files, even on iOS/macOS you can define a Cascade List to revert to different fonts in case one language is not supported by the current selected font (if you don’t declare a cascade list, iOS will always fall back to the system font):

- macOS Mojave has a new “word-of-the-day” screensaver
- For word emphasis, do not use italics, it doesn’t work in most of the languages, and if you use numbers, those will be the only thing italicized in your text 👎🏻. Bold is a better alternative.
- For character emphasis, use different colors (bold doesn’t work for structural languages such as Hindi and Korean), use `AttributedStrings`.
