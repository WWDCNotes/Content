## 1. Device and Server Architecture

### 1. Receive Transaction

### 2. Verify Authenticity

#### App Store Receipt
    
It's a trusted record of App and In-App purchases, stored on device, issued by the App Store.

It's for your app, on that device only.

#### Receipt Validation
    
On-device vs Server-to-server.
    
- __Don't__ use online validation directly from the device.
- Request from Apple
- Send binary receipt data to your own server.
- The server send it to Apple Server to get it verified or not.

### 3. Update Subscription Status

__orignal_transaction_id -> user’s subscription ID__
  
  Does user have active subscription?

1. Filter transactions by original_transaction_id
2. Find the transaction with latest expires_date (sort transactions by expires_date)
3. Date in the past shows user not active subscribed.
4. Date in future shows user active

#### Status Polling

Discover new transactions directly from your server.
  
  - Save latest version of encoded receipt data on your serer(latestReceiptData, exclude-old-transactions: true)
  - Treat receipt data like a token
  - /verifyReceipt response also includes new transactions
  - Located in the latest_receipt_info field
  - Unlock new subscription periods without waiting for app to launch
  
  New transactions will still appear in StoreKit on next app launch
  - Must verify and finish these transactions
  - Even if your server already knows about them
  - Opportunity to update latest receipt data on server

#### Reacting to Billing Issues

1. Observe no renewal transaction appears 
2. Direct user to amend their billing details
3. Unblock user immediately when transaction occurs

## 2. In-App Experience

1. Creating User Accounts
2. Introductory Pricing
3. Upgrade/Downgrade Subscriptions
4. Subscription Management

## 3. Reducing Subscriber Churn

Problem: 

1. Involuntary churn
2. Voluntary churn
3. Winback

Solution:

1. Leverage subscription specific receipt fields 
2. Implement status polling
3. Implement customer messaging
4. Present contextual subscription offers 

## Summary 
- Server side state management offers more flexibility
- Use notifications from the App Store
- Offer introductory pricing
- Reduce churn with simple messaging
- Win back users with alternative subscription options
- New reporting tools in App Store Connect
