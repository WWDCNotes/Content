Five elements of intentional design:

1. Radical Simplification
  - remove everything, just keep what people need

2. Deep Understanding
  - know the person that you want to reach and the actually problem that they have.

3. Extreme Focus
  - Focus on the value that you want to bring
  - Know what people really want

4. Personal Connection
  - Edginess can help your app connect to people
  - Make your app memorable

5. Direct Communication
  - Draw on what people know
