Designing an interface is fundamentally about serving other human beings.

The goal isn't to make a beautiful, well-organized, simple, or focused app. The goal is about serving the human beings or positively affecting the lives of the people who use the apps that you make.

The only thing that really matters is how well your app satisfies the emotional and practical needs of the people you are designing for.

Users need to:

- feel safe
- understand
- accomplish tasks and achieve our goals
- experience beauty

Well designed apps provide:

- Predictability and stability
- clear and helpful information
- streamlined and simple workflows
- a delightful experience

Design principles don't tell us how to do specific things in our design, they tell us why we should do those things.

This talk is separate in the following design principles:

- Wayfinding
- Feedback
- Visibility
- Consistency
- Mental Model
- Proximity
- Grouping
- Mapping
- Affordance
- Progressive Disclosure
- 80/20 Rule
- Symmetry

## Wayfinding

- Good wayfinding systems offer a comprehensive and understandable list of general locations that people can visit
- They provide needed detail about what's in those locations
- They are highly contextual
- They become increasingly specific as we navigate deeper and deeper into the system
- They help people to orient themselves by clearly highlighting their current location relative to other locations
- They provide a clear exit path

Wayfinding helps us to feel safe by answering really basic questions like: 

- Where am I? 
- Where can I go? 
- What will I find when I get there? 
- What's nearby? 
- How do I get out? 

Without answers to questions like these, we'd be lost. 

Your app's interface is one big wayfinding system:

- the navigation bar, the content area, the tab bar, they're all just tools for providing wayfinding in your app
- the navigation bar title and selected tab bar item lets people know where they are
- ...

## Feedback

Car example:

- Feedback helps us to operate cars confidently and safely
- Feedback helps us to anticipate problems that might cause the car to stop functioning properly or to stop moving all together

Cars provide various forms of feedback:

- **Status feedback** - to let us know how the car is doing
- **Completion feedback** - to let us know whether actions we've performed are completed successfully or have failed
- **Warning feedback** - to tell us about potential problems
- **Errors feedback** - to let us know when something we've tried to do has caused an error

For our safety, for the safety of other drivers and pedestrians, the feedback that cars provide must be clear, immediate, and understandable.

Feedback answers super important questions: 

- What can I do?
- What just happened?
- What is currently happening?
- What will happen in the future? 

### Status feedback 

Examples:

- looking at the gear shifter, I can see that the car is in park
- knowing what gear the car is in is super important information, it is so important that it's displayed twice, on the gearshift, and in the instrument cluster
- fuel level, letting us anticipate and predict how far we can go before we need to refuel
- speedometer shows us the current speed, helping us to avoid getting costly speeding tickets. 

Status information in apps should be just as clear for the car:

- in the mail.app, unread status indicators help people to prioritize which emails to read first. 
- in calendar.app, status indicators help people to see when someone can't make a meeting and it helps them determine if they need to reschedule
- in the camera.app, there are three elements to let people know that a video is being recorded: 
  - the red dot
  - the incrementing time code
  - the state of the record button

Showing status clearly and directly is crucial for saving people time and helping them to avoid making mistakes.

### Completion feedback 

Examples:

- when we turn on the engine:
  - we can hear the engine turn over
  - we can feel the vibration of the motor running
  - we see that instrument cluster come to life

- when we change shift, the shift gives us a tactile feedback to let us know that we're moving through gears

- as soon as we pull out of the parking spot, we hear the doors lock
  - this happens automatically, so it is even more important that we get this feedback

Completion feedback in apps serves the very same purpose: 

- the sound of a locked iPhone
- the animation of an email being marked as unread
- the animation of an email being deleted
- the animation and sound of a successful Apple Pay transaction

Every action taken in your app should provide some form of confirmation feedback, because it is absolutely necessary for letting people know that actions they've performed were successful.

### Warning feedback 

Examples:

- Low fuel level
- Low break pads
- Low oil level

Warnings can be communicated using status indicators, messages, and the instrument cluster, built-in display, sounds, or all of the above. 

These warnings are important. They keep us safe, and they protect our car from damage. 

### Errors feedback 

- if you try to start a car without gas, you will get an error message about that
- errors are always disappointing and frustrating
- it's best to help people avoid making errors in the first place. 
- Clear, timely, and understandable and informative feedback is essential

## Visibility

- The usability of a design is greatly improved when controls and information are clearly visible
- in the Mail.app, badges provide helpful status information about email messages
- it is important to surface key status information at higher levels whenever possible.
- tradeoff: densely packed interfaces can be overwhelming and they can slow decision-making, especially for people who are new to your app
  - visibility has to be weighed against other considerations

## Consistency 

- the principle is about representing similar design features in similar ways
- consistency improves usability
- you have to fully consider what expectations people have when they come to your app
- those expectations are mostly informed by their experiences with the other apps that they use
- you should pay attention to platform conventions, iconography, terminology, navigation schemes, etc.
- internal consistency helps to make an app feel cohesive or whole

## Mental Model

- You have a mental model of every system that you've ever interacted with
- Mental models are developed through personal experience, and they're based on an incomplete set of facts, so everyone's mental model is unique

Two parts of a mental model:

 - **System Model** - how a system works
 - **Interaction Model** -how we interact with the system

- when a system doesn't match our mental model, it breaks our expectations, and we perceive it to be unintuitive:
  - Labels and subtle variations of form are design cues that can easily be overlooked, especially when people have deeply ingrained notions about how a system works, and how they interact with it
  - Trying to get people to change their mental model of how your app works is risky.
  - Changes to any long-lived existing product will inevitably be hard for people to adjust to. It really doesn't matter how good or how necessary those changes may be
  - When considering big changes to an existing app, you have to be 100 percent positive that those changes will lead to clear wins for the people who currently use your app

Making changes just for the sake of it is not a good justification. Prove to yourself beyond a shadow of a doubt that your innovations are objectively better.

## Proximity 

- Proximity is about the distance between a control and the object that it affects
- The closer a control is to that object, the more we assume there to be a connection between the two
- Greater proximity also makes ergonomic sense: the closer you are to an object or region of interest, the more likely you are to want to interact with it and control it
- Proximity is also useful for expressing relationships between controls
  - e.g., if you see a set of switches on the wall, and you know that one of them controls lights, then it's reasonable for you to assume that every switch is a light switch
  - If one of them controls the shade, then it would be better to separate it out from the rest
  - This configuration makes it easier for people to remember which switch controls the shade, and which ones control the lights

## Grouping

- Grouping helps people to understand the relationships between elements, and it is key for giving a design structure
- the need for proximity and grouping is higher the larger your interface is

## Mapping

- Mapping is about designing controls to resemble the objects that they affect
- Mapping also relates to how controls are arranged relative to each other
  - Their order should resemble the configuration of the objects that they affect
  - e.g., say there are three light switches to control three sets of ceiling lights in the bedroom. Good mapping involves arranging the switches to mirror the layout of those lights

- By focusing on mapping, it is so much easier to make choices about where to position controls, how to order them, and even which controls to use

## Affordance

- An object physical characteristics:
  - provide visual and tactile cues about what interactions it affords to us
  - make certain actions seem possible, and others less possible

- Affordance is not an attribute of the object itself, it's more about the relationship that individuals have to an object
- Affordance is subjective, it varies based on one's physical abilities.

## Progressive Disclosure

Progressive disclosure is a technique for managing complexity:

- it eases people from the simple to the more complex
- Progressive Disclosure is also about hiding away complexity, so that people can accomplish basic tasks with simple and more approachable interfaces
- Progressive disclosure is a necessary and helpful technique for managing complexity and simplifying decision making
- But the same technique can bury information or functionality. 

## 80/20 Rule

- 80 percent of a system's effects come from 20 percent of its causes
- For an app, this might mean that either: 
  - 80 percent of its benefit comes from 20 percent of the actions that it presents
  - 80 percent of the people who use an app are only going to use 20 percent of its functions. 

- if your app is complex, it is okay to make the most useful 20 percent of functions easier to find by hiding the other 80 percent

- By keeping things simple for novices, they are less likely to feel intimidated, overwhelmed, or get themselves into trouble, while more experienced users can quickly reveal the options and actions that they require, that they understand, and that they are capable of using

## Symmetry

- Reflectional, bilateral, radial, rotational, and translational symmetry
- Symmetrical forms are efficient forms, and we tend to associate them with good health, with stability, balance, and orderliness
- Symmetrical forms are considered aesthetically pleasing
- Symmetrical elements, even if they are not physically connected to each other, are perceived as though they are (e.g., two facing square brackets, ` [ ] ` , our mind unconsciously integrates them into one coherent object)

- Attractive interfaces tend to demonstrate a mixture of reflectional and translational symmetry

- For example in some apps key elements are centered along a median line, while almost all of the other elements are counter-balanced with each other:

| Camera.app | Clock.app | Phone.app | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![][sym-camera] | ![][sym-clock] | ![][sym-phone] |

- Translational symmetry gives an interface a sense of structure, and order through the repetition of like elements. 
- For example you can see translational symmetry in the even repetition of cities and times in the clock.app, or the cadence of locations in the weather.app.

| Clock.app | Weather.app |
| --- | --- |
| ![][sym-clock-2] | ![][sym-weather] |

- When laying out your app's interface, look for opportunities to use symmetry to provide a sense of balance and order

## Conclusions

- These design principles express fundamental truths about human perception and cognition
- They are simple, but powerful reminders about the true nature and purpose of design 
- They provide a framework for understanding, and a language for articulating a design's strengths and its shortcomings
- Each of these principles could lead you into different directions about what you should do with the design of your app
- It is also possible to have too much of a good thing:
  - Too much feedback is annoying. Too much visibility is distracting. 
  - Too much progressive disclosure can make work flows inefficient. 

- Platform. Screen size. Use case. The experience level of the people who you are designing for. These factors and more should influence what principles are most relevant at any given moment.
