- Foundation provides building block classes
  - Fundamental types used by all applications
  - Assembled by higher level software (all applications on the system)

- Introduces consistent conventions
- Raises lower-level concepts
  - Foundation wraps up complex OS level tasks, so you can focus on your problem domain instead of nuts and bolts of how exactly to do things

## Where is Foundation?

- Foundation is just another framework used in your app
- Foundation itself relies on other frameworks such as CFNetwork and CoreFoundation
- Foundation is also used by other frameworks such as UIKit and AppKit

## Building blocks

### Collections

- A place to put your objects
- Most commonly used features:
  - Iterating
  - Sorting
  - Filtering

Three main collections:

| Collection | Prime Directive |
| --- | --- |
| `NSArray` / `NSMutableArray` | Preserves order |
| `NSDictionary` / `NSMutableDictionary` | Maps key objects to value objects |
| `NSSet` / `NSMutableSet` | Unique, unordered objects |

#### Collection Iteration

- `for` loop

```objc
NSUInteger count = [array count];
for (NSUInteger i = 0; i < count; i++) {
  id value = [array objectAtIndex:i];
  ...
}

NSArray *values = [dictionaryOrSet allObjects];
count = [values count];
for (NSUInteger i = 0; i < count; i++) {
  id value = [values objectAtIndex:i];
  ...
}

```

- Using `NSEnumerator` with `while` loop

An enumerator is a Foundation object that can keep track of your location and iteration for you.

```objc
NSEnumerator *e = [arrayOrSet objectEnumerator];
while (id object = [e nextObject]) {
  // extra step required for index
  ...
}

NSEnumerator *e = [dictionary keyEnumerator];
while (id key = [e nextObject]) {
  id value = [e objectForKey:key];
  // or, use objectEnumerator and iterate objects directly
  ...
}
```

- Fast enumeration with `for...in`
  - It's fast for two reasons:
    1. it actually performs faster, as it uses some implementation details of how these collections are created to retrieve groups of objects and actually have better performance.
    2. because you have to write less code

```objc
for (id object in arrayOrSet) {
  // no easy access to index for array here
  ...
}

for (id key in dictionary) {
  // requires extra step to get object
  id value = [dictionary objectForKey:key];
  ...
}
```

- Blocks (new in Snow Leopard and iOS 4)

```objc
[array enumerateObjectsUsingBlock:^(id object, NSUInteger index, BOOL *stop) {
  // your code here
}];

[dictionary enumerateKeysAndObjectsUsingBlock:^(id key, id object, BOOL *stop) {
  // your code here
}];

[set enumerateObjectsUsingBlock:^(id object, BOOL *stop) {
  // your code here
}];
```

Recommended iteration method:

- Mac OS X 10.0: `for` loop or `NSEnumerator`
- Mac OS X 10.5, iPhone OS 2: `for` loop or fast enumeration
- Mac OS X 10.6, iOS 4: Fast enumeration or Block enumeration

#### Sorting an `NSArray`

Determine sort order using:
- C function
- Objective-C method
- `NSSortDescriptor` - class that lets you specify which properties on an array or an object in an array that you want to sort on. 
- Blocks

- For immutable or mutable arrays, return a new object
- For mutable arrays, method to sort in place

Example where we sort an array of strings by length:

```objc
NSMutableArray *names = ...; // array of NSString objects
[names sortUsingComparator:^(id left, id right) {
  NSComparisonResult result;
  NSUInteger lLen = [left length], rLen = [right length];
  if (lLen < rLen) {
    result = NSOrderedAscending;
  } else if (lLen > rLen) {
    result = NSOrderedDescending;
  } else {
    result = NSOrderedSame;
  }
  return result;
}];
```

#### Filtering

> ⚠️ do not mutate a collection while enumerating it, this causes an exception.

To filter a collection, either:

- Mutate a copy
- Gather changes on the side, then apply

Example of the latter:

```objc
NSMutableArray *files = ...; // array of NSString objects
NSIndexSet *toRemove = [files indexesOfObjectsPassingTest:^(id obj, NSUInteger idx, BOOL *stop) {
  if ([obj hasPrefix:@"."]) return YES;
    return NO;
}];

[files removeObjectsAtIndexes:toRemove];
```

#### More Collection features

- Searching
- Apply selector to each item
- `NSArray`: Slicing and concatenation
- `NSSet`: Intersection, union, set subtraction

### Strings

- `NSString` is an object container for most text on the system
  - Array of Unicode characters
  - Treat as opaque container - `NSString` has a ton of methods on it that let you manipulate strings and do other kinds of string operations.

- Common uses:
  - Comparison
  - Searching
  - Converting encodings

#### Comparing Strings

```objc
-(NSComparisonResult)compare:(NSString *)string;
-(NSComparisonResult)localizedCompare:(NSString *)string;

/// This encapsulates what Apple thinks are the best practices for the options 
/// to compare strings with if you're going to display them in a manner to the user.
/// This will take into account the user's current locale, all of their preferences 
/// and so on.
-(NSComparisonResult)localizedStandardCompare:(NSString *)string;
-(NSComparisonResult)compare:(NSString *)string
                     options:(NSStringCompareOptions)mask
                     range:(NSRange)compareRange
                     locale:(id)locale;
```

Example:

```objc
NSString *str1 = @"string A";
NSString *str2 = @"string B";
NSComparisonResult result = [str1 compare:str2];
// result is: NSOrderedAscending

NSArray *strings = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"Larry", @"Curly", @"Moe", nil];
NSArray *sortedStrings = [strings sortedArrayUsingSelector:@selector(localizedCompare:)];
// result is: "Curly", "Larry", "Moe"
```

#### Searching Strings

```objc
-(NSRange)rangeOfString:(NSString *)aString;
-(NSRange)rangeOfString:(NSString *)aString
                options:(NSStringCompareOptions)mask
                  range:(NSRange)searchRange
                 locale:(NSLocale *)locale;
```

- `NSRange` has a location and length

Why do we need to know the length of the range? Isn't it the same as `aString`?  
Because of different unicode representations. There might be cases where the same string matches strings with different lengths, for example `José` can be stored as `José` or as `Jose´` (`e´` is called a _decomposed character_).

As of iPhone OS 3.2, `NSStringCompareOptions` supports `NSRegularExpressionSearch`:

```objc
str = @"Going going gone!";
found = [str rangeOfString:@"go(\\w*)"
                   options:NSRegularExpressionSearch
                     range:NSMakeRange(0, [str length])];
// found.location = 6, found.length = 5
```
#### String Encodings

- An encoding is a map of numbers to characters
- When you create a string from data, it's always important to know what encoding that data is stored in

```objc
/// From NSData to NSString
NSData *data = ...;
NSString *inString = [[NSString alloc] initWithData:data 
                                           encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];

/// From NSString to NSData
NSString *outString = @"For Windows";
NSData *converted = [outString dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF16StringEncoding];
```

If you need a `char *` to pass through a system call (like Open), you should use `NSString`'s convenience method `fileSystemRepresentation`.

- this will get you a character pointer that points to the data in the correct encoding for the system
- the data that's pointed to by that `char *` is autoreleased

```objc
const char *fileName = [outString fileSystemRepresentation];
```

#### More String Features

- printf-style formatting
- Enumeration of substrings, lines, and paragraphs (can do this in a language-independent way)
- Replacement of substrings
- Path completion
- Mutability (via `NSMutableString`)

### Dates and times

- Encapsulate complexity of date and time calculations
- Automatically handle user preferences
- Common uses:
  - Represent a date in a calendar
  - Find amount of time between two dates
  - Format a date or number correctly for user in any locale

#### Main classes

`NSDate`

- An invariant point in time
- Calendar and time zone independent (you can't present an `NSDate` to a user without knowing a calendar and time zone)
- Time is measured as seconds since a reference point, a `Double`

`NSCalendar`

- Defines beginning, length, and divisions of a year
- Example: Gregorian calendar, Hebrew calendar

`NSDateComponents`

- Simple object structure
- Contains storage for year, month, day, etc.
- Exact meaning of properties depends on calendar

Example how many days there are between Christmas and Black Friday in 2010:

```objc
// Find Christmas
NSCalendar *cal = [[NSCalendar alloc] initWithCalendarIdentifier:NSGregorianCalendar];

NSDateComponents *components = [[NSDateComponents alloc] init];
[components setYear:2010];
[components setMonth:12];
[components setDay:25];

NSDate *christmas = [cal dateFromComponents:components];

// Find Thanksgiving
NSDateComponents *tComps = [[NSDateComponents alloc] init];
[tComps setYear:2010];
[tComps setMonth:11];
[tComps setWeekday:5]; // 5 is Thursday in NSGregorianCalendar
[tComps setWeekdayOrdinal:4];

NSDate *thanksgiving = [cal dateFromComponents:tComps];

// Find Black Friday (the day after Thanksgiving (shows how to add date components to dates)
NSDateComponents *toAdd = [[NSDateComponents alloc] init];
[toAdd setDay:1];

NSDate *blackFri = [cal dateByAddingComponents:toAdd
                                        toDate:thanksgiving
                                       options:0];
// Find number of days between dates
NSDateComponents *diff = [cal components:NSDayCalendarUnit
                                fromDate:blackFri
                                  toDate:christmas
                                 options:0];
NSInteger days = [diff day]; // days == 29
```

#### More Dates and times features

- Find day of the week for a date
- Time zone calculations
- Converting between calendars

#### NSFormatter

- used for converting values to and from strings

The talk focuses on two main formatters:

- `NSDateFormatter`
  - Convert date to or from a string

- `NSNumberFormatter`
  - Convert number to or from a string

Each class has a set of pre-defined styles, or use your own.

Get String from Date:

```objc
NSDateFormatter *fmt = [[NSDateFormatter alloc] init];
[fmt setTimeStyle:NSDateFormatterNoStyle];
[fmt setDateStyle:NSDateFormatterLongStyle];
NSLog(@"Thanksgiving is: %@", [fmt stringFromDate:thanksgiving]);
// > Thanksgiving is: November 25, 2010

// Here I used the current system time zone and calendar, 
// because I haven't specified them to the formatter.
```

If you're parsing a string:

```objc
NSDateFormatter *fmt = [[NSDateFormatter alloc] init];
[fmt setDateFormat:@"dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm"];
[fmt setTimeZone:[NSTimeZone timeZoneWithName:@"America/Los_Angeles"]];
[fmt setCalendar:cal];
NSDate *date = [formatter dateFromString:@"10/06/2010 9:30"];
```

Format strings conform to Unicode Standard TR35-6

### Persistence and archiving

Store data to disk for later retrieval:

- Property lists
- User preferences
- Keyed archives
- Large, complex data structures

#### Property lists - `NSPropertyListSerialization`

- Stores a small amount of structured data
- Cross-platform and human readable (XML format)
  - Plists also have a binary format that is better performing. So you can choose which format to use depending on what your requirements are

- Property list allowed types:
  - `NSArray`, `NSDictionary`
  - `NSString`
  - `NSDate`
  - `NSNumber` (integer, floating point, boolean)
  - `NSData` (PLists are designed to handle _small_ amount of data)

Store a Plist:

```objc
NSDictionary *colors = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:@"Verde", @"Green", @"Rojo",@"Red", @"Amarillo", @"Yellow", nil];

NSError *error = nil;
NSData *plist = [NSPropertyListSerialization dataWithPropertyList:colors
                                                           format:NSPropertyListXMLFormat_v1_0
                                                          options:0
                                                            error:&error];
if (!plist) [NSApp presentError:error];
```

Note the error handling pattern:

- If `plist` is `nil`, then the `error` parameter has been filled out
- If `plist` is not `nil`, the error parameter that you pass in will be completely untouched, Foundation will not modify it in any way

Read a PList:

```objc
NSData *readData = [NSData dataWithContentsOfURL:urlOfFile];
NSDictionary *newColors = [NSPropertyListSerialization propertyListWithData:readData
                                                                    options:0
                                                                     format:nil
                                                                      error:&error];
if (!newColors) [NSApp presentError:error];
```

#### User preferences - `NSUserDefaults`

- Stores small values representing user preferences
- Organized by domain, which is a group of defaults
- Domains searched in specific order:
  - Arguments to executable (volatile)
  - Application (stored in the user home directory)
  - Global (system-wide location)
  - Language (for locale-specific preferences, volatile)
  - Registration (factory settings of your application, volatile)

Set Registration Domain Defaults

```objc
+ (void)initialize {
  NSDictionary *appDefaults = [NSDictionary
    dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:
      [NSNumber numberWithBool:YES], @"FrogBlastVentCore",
      @"iPad", @"DefaultDeviceName",
      [NSNumber numberWithInt:3], @"PiValue", nil];

  NSUserDefaults *defaults = [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults];

  [defaults registerDefaults:appDefaults];
}
```

Read User Default

```objc
BOOL doIt = [defaults boolForKey:@"FrogBlastVentCore"];
// doIt == YES
```

Read Executable Arguments

```objc
// Run your app with:
// MyApp.app/Contents/MacOS/MyApp -ConferenceName WWDC
NSString *argPref = [defaults stringForKey:@"ConferenceName"];
// argPref is "WWDC"
```

Set User Default

```objc
[defaults setBool:NO forKey:@"FrogBlastVentCore"];

// later...
doIt = [defaults boolForKey:@"FrogBlastVentCore"];
// doIt == NO
```

#### Keyed archives

- for storing an arbitrary graph of objects
- its primary design purpose is to enable easy backward and forward compatibility
  - because in a keyed archive, the way it works is you associated keys with your object values. You can add a key in a future version of your app, and the past versions of your app don't have to read that key, and vice versa.

- Allows for substitutions during encode and decode
- Objects do not need to be property list types
- Object must implement [`NSCoding`][NSCoding] protocol
  - The way that the keyed archiver knows how to encode and decode your objects is by the `NSCoding` protocol that your objects implement.

Implementing `NSCoding`.  
Let's say that we have the following `Robot` definition:

```objc
@interface Robot : NSObject <NSCoding> {
  NSString *name;
  Robot *nemesis;
  NSInteger model;
}
@property (copy) NSString *name;
@property (retain) Robot *nemesis;
@property NSInteger model;
@end
```

To implement `NSCoding`, I need to fill out two methods:

```objc
// To encode our object, we need to tell the keyed archiver 
// how to store the data that we have as our properties:
- (void)encodeWithCoder:(NSCoder *)coder {
  [coder encodeObject:name forKey:@"name"];
  [coder encodeObject:nemesis forKey:@"nemesis"];
  [coder encodeInteger:model forKey:@"model"];
}

- (id)initWithCoder:(NSCoder *)coder {
  self = [super init];
  name = [[coder decodeObjectForKey:@"name"] copy];
  nemesis = [[coder decodeObjectForKey:@"nemesis"] retain];
  model = [coder decodeIntegerForKey:@"model"];
  return self;
}
```

Archiving:

```objc
// Note how r1 and r2 reference each other, but keyed archiver will handle that.
Robot *r1 = [[Robot alloc] init], *r2 = [[Robot alloc] init];
r1.name = @"Bender"; r1.nemesis = r2; r1.model = 22;
r2.name = @"Flexo";  r2.nemesis = r1; r2.model = 22;

NSData *data = [NSKeyedArchiver archivedDataWithRootObject:r2];
```

Unarchiving:

```objc
Robot *r3 = [NSKeyedUnarchiver unarchiveObjectWithData:data];

NSLog(@"Nemesis is: %@", r3.nemesis.name);
// Nemesis is: Bender
```

#### Large, complex data structures - Core Data

Features:

- Support for key-value coding and key-value observing
- Validation of values and consistency of relationships
- Change tracking and undo
- Sophisticated queries
- Incremental editing

#### Persistence Cheat Sheet

| Data Type | Recommended Persistence Method |
| --- | --- |
| User preferences | `NSUserDefaults` |
| Small files, cross-platform | `NSPropertyListSerialization` |
| Object graph with cycles, non-property list types | `NSKeyedArchiver` |
| Large data set, object relational database | Core Data |
| Specialized data | Custom Format |

### Files and URLs

- `NSURL` is the preferred way to reference files and resources
- URLs are used with the file system through `NSFileManager`
- URLs are used with a network resource through the URL loading classes

Creating URLs

```objc
// Local URLs
NSURL *file = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:@"/Users/tony/file.txt"];
NSURL *up = [file URLByDeletingLastPathComponent];
NSURL *file2 = [up URLByAppendingPathComponent:@"file2.txt"];

// Web URLs
NSURL *aapl = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://www.apple.com"];
```

### Bundles

- Group code and resources
- Include code for different platforms and architectures
- Simplify loading localized resources

Loading a Bundle Resource

```objc
NSBundle *bundle = [NSBundle mainBundle];
NSURL *url = [bundle URLForResource:@"localizedImage"
                      withExtension:@"png"];
```

#### Bundle vs. Packages

|  | Bundle | File Package | Bundle + File Package |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Primary Class | `NSBundle` | `NSFileWrapper` | `NSBundle` |
| Use | Code and Resources | User Documents | Application Code and resources |
| For Example | <kbd>.framework</kbd> | <kbd>.rtfd</kbd> | <kbd>.app</kbd> |

- the idea of file packages is to treat a directory that contains all the appropriate resources and attachments to the text and so forth, as one document in the finder. So the user can't lose associated pieces of their documents.
  - double-clicking on a rich text document will open its default editor.

#### More Bundle Features

- Bundles can load other bundles (plug in system)
- You can locate the various components of a bundle
- You can locate list all its resources of a type or in a subdirectory
- Support for localized strings

### Operation queues

- Object-oriented way to describe work
- Simplifies design of concurrent applications

Two main classes:

- Operations
- Operation Queues

#### Operations - `NSOperation`

- Encapsulates a work unit
- you use it by subclassing and overriding the `-main` to define your work 
- Or use one of the Foundation-provided subclasses:
  - `NSInvocationOperation` - lets you specify a target and selector
  - `NSBlockOperation` - lets you specify your work as a block

#### Operation Queues - `NSOperationQueue`

- Maintains list of operations to perform
- Runs operations concurrently or serially

Using an NSOperation Subclass

```objc
@interface MyOp : NSOperation
@end
@implementation MyOp
- (void)main {
  // Your work goes here
}
@end

// elsewhere...
NSOperationQueue *queue = [[NSOperationQueue alloc] init];
MyOp *op = [[MyOp alloc] init];
[queue addOperation:op];
```

Other NSOperation Features

- You can set up dependencies between operations even if those operations are in different queues.
- You can set up priorities of operations within a queue
- Key-value observing compatible properties (so you can find out when it's running, when it's finished, etc.)
- you can have a block run when you're operation is finished
