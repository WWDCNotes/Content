## Authentication methods

- Memorized passwords; people generally aren’t good at coming up with and remembering strong and unique passwords for every account
- Password managers; can create strong, unique passwords per account, and can provide hints about some forms of possible phishing. iCloud Keychain’s password manager is built into iOS/macOS
- Password + OTP; macOS Monterey and iOS 15 have a code generator built in to the iCloud Keychain password manager
- Federated authentication; lets people keep their trust confined to a small number of highly protected accounts (e.g., Sign in with Apple)

Besides federated authentication, all of these methods rely on a shared secret between the user and a server, making them fundamentally no stronger than the weakest protection of that shared secret.

## Properties of a password solution:

- secure by design
- easy to use
- works everywhere
- recoverable

## Security keys (hardware dongles or fobs)

- One of the strongest security options available today
- [WebAuthn standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAuthn) (essentially RSA)
- Generally easy to use
- More secure than passwords
- usable on a wide variety of devices
- no server-side secrets
- trust comes from the browser and operating system; not the human
- credentials are only ever usable on the websites and apps that they were created for

Cons:

- they’re not necessarily always with you
- if the key is lost/stolen, adopters must have a backup system in place, such as purchasing an additional security key, storing it somewhere safe, and hoping they never lose both at the same time

Security keys support:

- all browsers on iOS 14.5+
- new security key API available from macOS Monterey and iOS 15, available to use in all apps on macOS and iOS, part of [`ASAuthorization`][ASAuthorization]

## Passkeys in iCloud Keychain

- Technology preview (off by default, only use for testing)
- Apple’s contribution to a post-password world
- builds the security of WebAuthn into every iPhone, iPad, and Mac
- powered by WebAuthn
- new type of credential, called a <kbd>passkey</kbd>, stored in your iCloud Keychain

## How to support passkeys in iCloud Keychain

- for that strong, platform-provided phishing protection to work for your apps, the device needs a strong association between your app and website. This is done through associated domains, using the <kbd>webcredentials</kbd> association type.

E.g., this is the file returned from your website at <kbd>https://example.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association</kbd>:

```json
{
  "webcredentials": {
    "apps": [ "A1B2C3D4E5.com.example.Shiny" ]
  }
}
```

How to register an account:

- the function needs three inputs:
  1. a single-use challenge fetched from your server
  2. the username for the account
  3. the userID; generally the identifier for the account on your backend

```swift
func createAccount(with challenge: Data, name: String, userID: Data) {
  let provider = ASAuthorizationPlatformPublicKeyCredentialProvider(relyingPartyIdentifier: "example.com")

  let registrationRequest = provider.createCredentialRegistrationRequest(challenge: challenge, name: name, userID: userID)

  let controller = ASAuthorizationController(authorizationRequests: [registrationRequest])

  controller.delegate = …
  controller.presentationContextProvider = …

  controller.performRequests()
  // the perform request will trigger an iOS/macOS sheet to popup to prompt the 
  // user to create a new secret.
  // When the transaction is finished, you’ll receive a delegate callback with 
  // the details of the new credential.
}
```

Sign in:

```swift
func signIn(with challenge: Data) {
  let provider = ASAuthorizationPlatformPublicKeyCredentialProvider(relyingPartyIdentifier: "example.com")

  let assertionRequest = provider.createCredentialAssertionRequest(challenge: challenge)


  let controller = ASAuthorizationController(
      authorizationRequests: [ assertionRequest ])

  controller.delegate = …
  controller.presentationContextProvider = …

  controller.performRequests()
}
```

Handle returned credentials, this is the delegate function called whenever the authorization completes:

```swift
func authorizationController(controller: ASAuthorizationController, didCompleteWithAuthorization authorization: ASAuthorization) {
  switch authorization.credential {
    case let registration as ASAuthorizationPlatformPublicKeyCredentialRegistration:
      let attestationObject = registration.rawAttestationObject
      let clientDataJSON = registration.rawClientDataJSON
      // Verify on your server and finish creating the account.

    case let assertion as ASAuthorizationPlatformPublicKeyCredentialAssertion:
      let signature = assertion.signature
      let clientDataJSON = assertion.rawClientDataJSON
      // Verify on your server and finish signing in.

    case …:
      …
  }
}
```
