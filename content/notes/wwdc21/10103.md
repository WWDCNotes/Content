Each generation leap results in increased opportunities for app developers to push the envelope and deliver previously unheard-of experiences in your app

## Path to [5G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G)

5G provides other advances beyond just more data at a faster rate:

- faster round-trip times between your app and your server - meaning faster and more synchronized transactions
- 5G’s ability to handle more devices concurrently - you can continue to deliver data-related services in your app, even in congested public environments
- ...and more

## Built-in intelligence

Today’s modern 5G cellular networks come primarily in two varieties, Non-Standalone (NSA) and Standalone (SA).

- Non-Standalone
  - built on the existing LTE core
  - can use both LTE and 5G links to schedule traffic
  - operates at frequencies below seven gigahertz
  - includes support for millimeter wave

- Standalone
  - built entirely on the new 5G core
  - operates at frequencies below seven gigahertz
  - includes support for millimeter wave
  - delivers improved latency performance over LTE

Thanks to <kbd>Automatic Switch to 5G</kbd> and <kbd>Smart Data Mode</kbd>, iOS takes performance, security, and power into consideration when choosing which connectivity to use - your app can focus on the user experience.

## Practical guidance for developers

- ignore network type
- use high-level (Apple's) frameworks to take full advantage of 5G
  - AVFoundation for Media
  - CallKit for VOIP
  - Network framework/Foundation's URLSession

- tune your application for constrained and expensive paths
  - in most cases, these are automatically derived by the system based on the active cellular plan
  - the user can also affect these by altering the <kbd>Data Mode</kbd> settings on their device - there are three options:
    - Allow More Data on 5G - indicating an inexpensive path, similar to Wi-Fi
    - Standard mode - which is usually considered as expensive
    - Low Data Mode - which is considered constrained

The concept of **expensive** and **constrained** are surfaced as properties in all our high-level networking frameworks - the value of these properties should be your only consideration when determining the type of network services available for your app.

- `URLSession`'s [`allowsExpensiveNetworkAccess`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsessionconfiguration/3235752-allowsexpensivenetworkaccess)

```swift
private func fetchAsset(at fetchURL: URL, allowsExpensive: Bool) {
  var fetch = URLRequest(url: fetchURL,
                         cachePolicy: .reloadIgnoringLocalCacheData,
                         timeoutInterval: 60)
  fetch.allowsExpensiveNetworkAccess = allowsExpensive // 👈🏻
 
  // Fallback to low resolution fetch if network is expensive and unavailable
  URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: fetch) { [weak self] data, response, error in
    if let strongSelf = self,
      let error = error as? URLError,
      error.networkUnavailableReason == .expensive { // 👈🏻
        strongSelf.fetchAsset(at: strongSelf.lowResURLString, allowsExpensive: true)
    }
  }.resume()
}
```

> if your application implements policy based on expensive, provide a way for users to influence that policy

- In <kbd>Network.framework</kbd>, you have another option to check for constrained, expensive, and inexpensive path:

```swift
func onConnectionStateChange(_ connection: NWConnection) {
  guard let path = connection.currentPath else { return } // insure we have a path

  if connection.state == .ready {
    // Update your data usage heuristics based on cost for this connection
    
    if path.isConstrained {
      // Reduced Data Usage
    } else if path.isExpensive {
      // Default Data Usage
    } else {
      // Unrestricted Data Usage
    }
  }
}
```

- AVFoundation:
  - [`AVURLAssetAllowsConstrainedNetworkAccessKey`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avurlassetallowsconstrainednetworkaccesskey) - Allows network requests to use the constrained interface
  - [`AVURLAssetAllowsExpensiveNetworkAccessKey`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avurlassetallowsexpensivenetworkaccesskey) - Allows network requests to use the expensive interface
