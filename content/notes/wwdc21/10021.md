## Safe area

- By default, SwiftUI positions your content within the safe area, avoiding anything that would obscure or clip your view, like the Home indicator or any bars that are being shown. 
- The safe area is represented as a region that is inset from the outermost full area where a view is shown. 

## Background/Foreground view modifiers

`.background()` view modifier has new overloads with new behaviors:

- previous `.background()` view modifiers were applied with the same bounds to the view they were called on. 
- to make previous `.background()` effects go beyond the safe area, we had to call `.ignoreSafeArea()` on the background content, e.g. `.background { Color.red.ignoresSafeArea() }`
- the new background modifier gives you this behavior automatically by default

- the new overloads can accept:
  - a specific style, like `Color`, `Gradient`, or the new materials (think UIKit's `UIVibrancyEffect`)
  - a shape, to clip the background to a specific shape (when we use this, the background no longer goes beyond the safe area)

[`.foregroundStyle(_:)`][foregroundstyle(_:)] is a new view modifier that applies styles on top of another view. 

- similar to the new background overloads, it accepts styles
- when passing a [`ForegroundStyle`][ForegroundStyle] between `.secondary` and `.quaternary`, the content might be shown with an effect called Vibrancy, which blends the colors behind it. This happens when you explicitly add a background with a material, or when your content is in a system component, like a sidebar, that adds the material for you.
- Any given text can have a single foreground style applied to it, but multiple colors within its ranges (thanks to the new [AttributedString][AttributedString] API).

`.safeAreaInset(edge:content:)` is a new modifier that lets us reduce the content safe area of the view is applied to.

- it kind of work like an overlay, where the overlay placement is now considered part of the unsafe area
- for example, this allows to place views on top of `ScrollView`, and the edges of the scroll view content (not frame) will not be obscured by those views defined within `.safeAreaInset(edge:content:)`

## Canvas

Previously we had the [`drawingGroup(opaque:colorMode:)`][drawingGroup(opaque:colorMode:)] view modifier:

- drawingGroup tells SwiftUI to combine all of the views it contains in a single layer to draw
- drawingGroup works well for graphical elements, but shouldn't be used with UI controls, like text fields and lists

New `Canvas` view

- addresses some `drawingGroup(opaque:colorMode:)` shortcoming such as bookkeeping and storage required for each view
- similar to UIKit/AppKit `drawRect`

Example:

```swift
Canvas { context, size in 
  var image = context.resolve(Image(systemName: "sparkle"))
  image.shading = .color(.blue)
  let imageSize = image.size 
  context.blendMode = .screen

  for i in 0..<10 {
    let frame = CGRect(
      x: 0.5 * size.width + Double(i) * imageSize.width, y: 0.5 * size. height, 
      width: imageSize.width, height: imageSize.height
    ) 
    var innerContext = context
    innerContext.opacity = 0.5 
    innerContext.fill(Ellipse().path (in: frame), with: .color (.cyan))
    context.draw(image, in: frame) 
  }
}
```

## TimelineView

- new view letting you control exactly how something changes over time
- configurable via schedules like timers and animations
