## Page types

Documentation Catalog offers three page types:

- Reference - concise, in-depth information about individual APIs in your library. E.g., descriptions, code snippets, relationships
- Articles - free-form content, give the big picture of how a framework works and explaining how to complete a specific task
- Tutorials - step-by-step walk-through of a project that uses your framework

All page types follow the Markdown format.

### Top-level article

Top-level articles provide:

- a concise summary sentence
- an overview with content like images and code snippets
- a topics section with a few symbols you want to highlight

### Task article

- provide actionable first steps on how to get started with your library
- similar to top-level article, but focuses on teaching how to use parts of the library

### Adding articles to the documentation

- set up my project with a documentation catalog (`New File > Documentation Catalog`)
- a documentation catalog is a `.docc` file in the Xcode navigator that contains all my documentation files
- a new documentation catalog already comes with a top-level article by default

## Organization

- assets
  - to add assets, put them in the `Resources` under your documentation catalog
  - Image best practices to use `@2x` PNG files, add also `~dark` variant (if needed)
  - Assets can be added to `Resources` folder of the catalog, include via `![title](x.png)`
  - when referring to an image, only   the name + the format, e.g. `sloth.png`, Xcode will automatically select the correct appearance and scale

- articles
  - once added in the catalog, the DocC compiler automatically adds a `Topics` section to each page with all of the framework’s documentation.
  - to customize this, we can fill the `## Topics` section directly in the page
  - use the `<doc:...>` URL scheme to refer to articles
  - use double ``` ``...`` ``` back ticks to link to a symbol 
  - group types into groups, sort them from easy to complex

```markdown
## Topics

### Essentials

- <doc:GettingStarted>
- <doc:/tutorials/SlothCreator>
- ``LibraryType``
```

## Extensions

Extension files extend the documentation of each symbol by associating an extra (optional) documentation file

- this file links to a specific symbol by linking the extension file title

```markdown
# ``LibraryName/LibraryType``

## Topics
...
```

- DocC will automatically add the extension file content to the rest of the symbol documentation.
- Documentation can be exported so browsing in Xcode without package is possible
