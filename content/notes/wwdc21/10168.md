> [Sample code](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mailkit/build_mail_app_extensions)

- Mail plug-ins will stop working in a future macOS release
- New [MailKit framework][MailKit], macOS 12.0+
- Mail extensions are built on the same underlying foundation as other app extensions, like Safari app extensions and share sheet extensions
- can be distributed standalone, bundled in an app (even notarized ones)

Extension types:

- compose extensions - allow new workflows when composing mail messages
- action extensions - help people manage their inbox by providing custom rules on incoming messages
- content blocking extensions - provide WebKit content blockers for Mail messages
- message security extensions - provide further security by signing, encrypting, and decrypting messages when people send and receive mail

## Creating a new Mail Extension

When you create a new Mail extension, you will be asked which types (among the ones above) your extension will be. This will enable/disable capabilities on your extension accordingly.

The principal class of your extension must conform to the [`MEExtension`][MEExtension] protocol. 

- `MEExtension` exposes optional handler methods for each of the four types of extensions
- All the methods in `MEComposeSessionHandler` have a `MEComposeSession` argument which provides information about a compose window. Mail creates a unique `MEComposeSession` instance for every Mail compose window. Each window has a `MEMessage` property that exposes various details of the message being edited.

## Compose extensions

Four ways your extension can interact with a Mail compose window:

- validate/annotate recipient email addresses; as the user is editing them
- present a view controller with additional context about the message being composed; the view controller must be a subclass of [`MEExtensionViewController`][MEExtensionViewController]
- set additional headers on outgoing messages
- validate/alert the user of errors in the message before it is sent

For `MEComposeSession` you will need to provide a `MEComposeIcon` and `MEComposeIconToolTip` entries in your extension <kbd>Info.plist</kbd>:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <key>NSExtension</key>
  <dict>
    <key>NSExtensionAttributes</key>
    <dict>
      <key>MEComposeSession</key>
      <dict>
        <key>MEComposeIcon</key> // 👈🏻
        <string>lock</string>
        <key>MEComposeIconToolTip</key> // 👈🏻
        <string>Recipient Validation Extension</string>
      </dict>
    </dict>
    <key>NSExtensionPointIdentifier</key>
    <string>com.apple.email.extension</string>
    <key>NSExtensionPrincipalClass</key>
    <string>$(PRODUCT_MODULE_NAME).MailExtension</string>
  </dict>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Example on how to validate recipient addresses:

```swift
func annotateAddressesForSession(_ session: MEMailComposeSession) async -> [String: MEAddressAnnotation] {
  var annotations: [String: MEAddressAnnotation] = [:]
  
  // Iterate through all the recipients in the message.
  for address in session.mailMessage.allRecipientAddresses {
    // Annotate invalid recipients with an error.
    if address != "seth@example.com" {
      let message = "example.com is not a valid domain"
      let annotation = MEAddressAnnotation.error(withLocalizedDescription: message)
      annotations[address] = annotation
    }
  }

  return annotations
}
```

## Action extensions

Three types:

- mark messages as read and/or flag messages
- move to other standard system mailboxes (e.g., Junk, Trash or Archive)
- apply colors on messages in the message list

- Your action extension must implement [`MEMessageActionHandler`][memessageactionhandler]'s [`decideAction(for:completionHandler:)`][decideAction(for:completionHandler:)]
- `decideAction(for:completionHandler:)` is called with a `MEMessage` argument
- Mail calls your handler's decideAction for message for every new message that it downloads before it is even visible in the inbox.

## Content blocking extensions

- Your content blocking extension must implement an object conforming to [`MEContentBlocker`][MEContentBlocker]
- The content rule lists are specified using the same syntax as [Safari content blockers][scb], e.g.:

```xml
[
  {
    "action": { "type": "block" },
    "trigger": { "url-filter": "*.acme.*" }
  },
  ...
]
```

## Message security extensions 

- Your content blocking extension must implement an object conforming to [`MEMessageSecurityHandler`][MEMessageSecurityHandler]
- each time the sender or recipients change, Mail will call the `getEncodingStatus(for:completionHandler:)` method on the extension's message security handler
- when the message is sent, Mail will take the <kbd>RFC822</kbd> message data and pass it to the extension
  - the extension will sign and encrypt the message as needed, and return the signed and encrypted <kbd>RFC822</kbd> data back to Mail. Mail will then send this data to the outgoing server
