- provide as many timeline future entries as possible (when it makes sense for your app)
- support as many sizes as you possible, so that users have choice when placing their widgets

## Widgets relevance

- Time
- Presentation
- Location

## Widgets reloads

- Individual background reload budgets
- Budget updates throughout the day
- Influenced by viewing habits
- Variable update cadence per widget
- Updates are withheld until new budget is available
- A frequently viewed widget can be expected to receive 40-70 background updates per day
- Reloads are on the order of minutes/hours, not seconds

### Ways the widget will refresh

|    | Budgeted | Free |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TimelineReloadPolicy` API | ✅ |  |
| `WidgetCenter` reload API | ✅ | ✅ |
| Significant location changes |  | ✅ |
| System updates |  | ✅ |

- `TimelineReloadPolicy` API
  - Scheduled background updates `atEnd` `afterDate:` `never`
  - informs the system when you’d like to automatically refresh your widget in the background

- `WidgetCenter` API
  - Event-based triggers `.reloatTimelines(ofKind:)` `.reloadAllTimelines`
  - free when:
    - the reload occurs when the host app is in the foreground
    - the user is in a current session, like Navigation or Now Playing audio

- Significant location changes
  - budget-free update when the system detects a significant location change
  - this free refresh occurs when the user views your widget (not when the location changes)

- System updates
  - when a big change in the system happen:
    - the user changes an Accessibility preference like dynamic text or bold text
    - language or region change
    - iCloud or App Store account change
    - significant time change
    - and more

## TimelineReloadPolicy

- `atEnd`
  - marks your widget eligible to be refreshed when the current timeline last entry becomes relevant
  - recommended if your widget already has content that extends beyond the life of its current timeline
  - not recommended for single-entry timeline, as the system would choose a reload time for you
  - not recommended for data that loses accuracy over time (e.g. weather)
  - Apple apps using `atEnd` policy: Reminders, Calendar, Photos, Tips, and more

- `afterDate`
    - marks your widget eligible to be refreshed after the date you specify
    - recommended for widgets showing unpredictable data (that can change unpredictably/unexpectedly)
    - recommended for widgets showing data whose accuracy or relevance changes periodically
    - Apple apps using `afterDate` policy: Stocks, Weather, News, Mail, and more
    - be cautious of:
      - very frequent reloads (you risk to consume all refresh budget)
      - setting a date where new data will be available 
      - (if backend data driven) to not overload your servers (add jitter to the data, use caching servers)

- `never`
  - it never refreshes automatically
  - recommended for content that: 
    - only changes through user interaction
    - doesn't change 
    - gated on conditional access 

- 
  - Use `WidgetCenter` API to refresh from foreground application or events
  - Apple apps using `never` policy: TV, notes, music, podcast, contacts, and more

## Appearance 

### Full privacy redactions

- Individual views may now be automatically masked in privacy-sensitive environments
- new [`privacySensitive(_:)`][privacySensitive(_:)] view modifier: when the user is not authenticated, the view will automatically be masked/redacted

### default-data-protection entitlement

If your app leverages complete data protection that can’t be accessed while an iOS device is passcode locked (e.g. Health data), you can now tell WidgetKit to:

- replace your active timeline content with your placeholder content when the device is passcode locked for a full redaction of content
- withhold updates while the device is passcode locked

Adopt the entitlement `com.apple.developer.default-data-protection` with value `NSFileProtectionComplete` to opt in into this behavior

## Location

If you'd like to use user location in your widget:

1. add `NSWidgetUsesLocation` with `true` value in your `Info.plist`
2. use `CLLocationManager` from your `TimelineProvider` in your widget extension
  - use the lowest resolution possible (for faster location resolution and less battery usage)
  - use `isAuthorizedForWidgetUpdates` to check whether the widget can get the user location

### Location permission

|   |  Widget location accessible? |
| --- | --- |
| Never | |
| ask next time ("allow once") | |
| While using app | only when the widget’s container app is in the foreground or other situations that would consider the app to be in-use, like being in a navigation session |
| While using app or widgets | same as While using app, plus the widget can receive location up to 15 minutes after it was last viewed |
| Always | Yes |
