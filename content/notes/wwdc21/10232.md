- All features available from iOS app
- Shortcuts build editor rewritten
- App mostly written in SwiftUI
- A lot of new actions added to support Mac-specific needs
- Lots of FileProvider actions automatically supported for apps using FileProvider
- Shortcuts get their own file format & can be easily shared (e.g. on a website)
- Downloaded shortcuts ask for permission when accessing data libraries
- Shortcuts are signed or notarized for improved security
- Full support for AppleScript via new action
- Migration Tool that can convert most Automator workflows to Shortcuts
- Third party apps can expose actions from the app, system will make use in many places
- Data can be thought of as “Nouns”, the actions as “Verbs” – one action per verb
- Actions defined via SiriKit Intent Definition files, each action is an intent
- Minimum requirement is a `displayString` and `identifier` property – more possible
- Xcode creates classes to use in app, similar to generated Core Data model code
- App will need to handle incoming intents:
    - Either handle them in-app: Most apps should start with this
    - Or handle via Intent Extension: Lightweight standalone process
- AppDelegate methods `application(handlerFor: Intent)` needs to be implemented
- Implement an IntentHandler conforming to `<ActionName>IntentHandling`
- Intent definition file supports custom validation errors that can be "thrown" to the system
- Contributor comment: *Building an intent has 6 steps involved, it’s a lot of work, but worth it for pro users*
- Mac Catalyst apps intents automatically work on Mac, too
- Same exact intent definition can be used in both iOS & Mac apps for shared workflows
- MacOS has a command line tool called `shortcuts`
