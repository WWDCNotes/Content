## Visual updates

- new look with greater focus on the content and the associated media along with the application icon
- you can now associate notification actions with icons
  - pass a [`UNNotificationActionIcon`][UNNotificationActionIcon] instance into the [`UNNotificationAction`][UNNotificationAction] icon parameter
  - accepts both system or template images

```swift
// Setting up notification actions with icons

let likeActionIcon = UNNotificationActionIcon(systemImageName: "hand.thumbsup") // 👍🏻
let likeAction = UNNotificationAction(identifier: "like-action",
                                           title: "Like",
                                         options: [],
                                            icon: likeActionIcon)
        
let commentActionIcon = UNNotificationActionIcon(templateImageName: "text.bubble") // 💬
let commentAction = UNTextInputNotificationAction(identifier: "comment-action",
                                                       title: "Comment",
                                                     options: [],
                                                        icon: commentActionIcon,
                                        textInputButtonTitle: "Post",
                                        textInputPlaceholder: "Type here…")

let category = UNNotificationCategory(identifier: "update-actions",
                                         actions: [likeAction, commentAction],
                               intentIdentifiers: [], options: [])
```

## Notification management

- Notification summary
  - notifications can now be delivered at scheduled times in the day as a summary
  - reduces the number of active interruptions from incoming notifications and presents them collectively at preset times
  - include media attachments with the notification content so there is a better chance for that notification to be featured at the top of the notification summary
  - adopt the new [`UNNotificationContent`][UNNotificationContent] [`relevanceScore`][relevanceScore] to provide a relevance score for the notification content so the right notifications from the application get featured in the notification summary as well

- Focus
  - in iOS 15, devices can be set in a particular Focus based on the activity or time of day such as Reading, Sleep, or Work
  - when active, the device will filter the presentation and interruption of notifications
  - Focus configuration allows selecting people and applications that can send interruptive notifications
  - it's possible to break through these management controls

## Interruptions

New API for interruption levels as part of the `UserNotifications` framework

Interruption levels ([`UNNotificationInterruptionLevel`][UNNotificationInterruptionLevel])
- Passive (NEW)
  - delivered silently
  - available when the user will view the notification list
  - to be used when the notification does not require immediate attention but should be seen eventually

- Active (default level)
  - do not interrupt if configured not to

- Time Sensitive (NEW)
  - allowed to breakthrough, if it has been allowed
  - to be used when it is relevant to actively interrupt, requiring immediate attention

- Critical
  - requires approved entitlement

|  | sound or vibration | screen light up | system breakthrough^ | bypass ringer switch |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Passive | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Active | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Time Sensitive | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Critical | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 

> ^bypass notification summary and Focus

Set the interruption level while configuring the content object for the notification request

```swift
// Interruption levels
// Local notification

import UserNotifications

let content = UNMutableNotificationContent()
content.title = "Passive"
content.body = "I’m a passive notification, so I won’t interrupt you."
content.interruptionLevel = .passive

let trigger = UNTimeIntervalNotificationTrigger(timeInterval: 5, repeats: false)

let request = UNNotificationRequest(identifier: "passive-request-example",
                                       content: content,
                                       trigger: trigger)
```

For push notifications, provide a new key-value pair, with the key interruption level:

```json
{
  "aps" : {
    "alert" : {
      "title" : "Passive",
      "body" : "I’m a passive notification, so I won’t interrupt you."
    },
    "interruption-level" : "passive"
  }
}
```

### Announce

- Siri can announce notifications if there are compatible devices (AirPods) connected
- in iOS 14 it was available via [`UNNotificationCategoryOptions.allowAnnouncement`][UNNotificationCategoryOptions.allowAnnouncement]
- in iOS 15, any notification is automatically supported
- communication and time sensitive notifications will be announced by default
- communication notifications will be announced by default on CarPlay

## Time Sensitive

How to configure:

- enable the associated capability via Xcode for your application
- set the Time Sensitive interruption level on the notification request being posted

Time Sensitive local notification example:

```swift
let content = UNMutableNotificationContent()
content.title = "Urgent"
content.body = "Your account requires attention."
content.interruptionLevel = .timeSensitive

let trigger = UNTimeIntervalNotificationTrigger(timeInterval: 0, repeats: false)

let request = UNNotificationRequest(identifier: "time-sensitive—example",
                                       content: content,
                                       trigger: trigger)
```

Push notification payload example:

```json
{
  "aps" : {
    "alert" : {
      "title" : "Urgent",
      "body" : "Your account requires attention."
    },
    "interruption-level" : "time-sensitive"
  }
}
```

## Communication

- new API that allows your applications to signal what notifications are communications, and the people associated with those communications
- Siri will announce the contents of communication notifications on supported devices including HomePod, AirPods, and CarPlay
- Siri will provide suggestions to help prioritize these communication notifications
- People in your apps will get associated with people in Contacts.app
  - These associations are shown as suggestions on notifications.
  - Once a user confirms a suggestion, Siri Shortcuts are available for tasks with those people in your app
  - Siri will suggest relevant people to break through in the Focus configuration -- including those people associated with communications in your app

- needs to integrate with Siri intents ([`INStartCallIntent`][INStartCallIntent], [`INSendMessageIntent`][INSendMessageIntent])

- you need to update a NotificationContent object with a SiriKit intent in your app's NotificationServiceExtension
  - SiriKit intents are local to the device, and thus must be serviced locally
  - you can also do this in your main app process for local notifications

Example for message-related notification:

```swift 
// Create a messaging notification
// In UNNotificationServiceExtension subclass

func didReceive(_ request: UNNotificationRequest,
                withContentHandler contentHandler: @escaping (UNNotificationContent) -> Void) {
    let incomingMessageIntent: INSendMessageIntent = // ...
    let interaction = INInteraction(intent: incomingMessageIntent, response: nil)
    interaction.direction = .incoming
    interaction.donate(completion: nil)
    do {
        let messageContent = try request.content.updating(from: incomingMessageIntent)
        contentHandler(messageContent)
    } catch {
       // Handle error
    }
}
```

Example for call-related notification:

```swift
// Create a call notification
// In UNNotificationServiceExtension subclass

func didReceive(_ request: UNNotificationRequest,
                withContentHandler contentHandler: @escaping (UNNotificationContent) -> Void) {
    let incomingCallIntent: INStartCallIntent = // ...
    let interaction = INInteraction(intent: incomingCallIntent, response: nil)
    interaction.direction = .incoming
    interaction.donate(completion: nil)
    do {
        let callContent = try request.content.updating(from: incomingCallIntent)
        contentHandler(callContent)
    } catch {
       // Handle error
    }
}
```

- always set interaction direction to `.incoming` for notifications
- send intents also for outgoing interactions (a.k.a when the user sends messages or make calls)
  - Siri only learns from outgoing intent donations, so Contacts are not cluttered by people not engaged with

How to configure:

- enable the associated capability via Xcode for your application
- add intent types to `NSUserActivityTypes` in `Info.plist`
