## What are intents?

- a way of representing, in detail, a type of action that your app can perform
- Siri includes a lot of built-in intents that support a range of capabilities that you can use to integrate with the system (e.g., messaging, ride booking, payments)
- support the ability for you to define your own custom intents for use with Shortcuts

## What are intent donations?

- An intent donation is the act of telling the system when a person performs an action in your app
- The system will store these donations and use them to expand your app's capabilities and presence throughout the system
- Apps that donate intents show up in places throughout the system like Suggestions, Shortcuts, Focus, Smart Stack, and Siri

## The life of an intent donation

1. Create a new intent definition:

  - With your project open, create a new file of type <kbd>SiriKit Intent Definition</kbd> File
  - in the following menu select any targets that I want to use the custom intent

2. Define the intent
  - After selecting the new Intent file, click the <kbd>+</kbd> button on the bottom right and select <kbd>New Intent</kbd> (or <kbd>Customize System Intent</kbd> if your intent matches one of the existing built-in system intents)

3. Define eligibility
  - After naming your intent in step two, check whether you'd like your intent to be eligible for widgets/shortcuts/(Siri)suggestions

4. Define Intent parameters
  - These parameters are the input of your action/intent, which depend on your specific intent
  - For each parameter you can select the type (String/Location/URL... can be custom, too)
  - If the parameter options are not static and/or need to be provided by the app, check the <kbd>Dynamic Options</kbd> - this 

The system reads the intent definition file to determine the intent and parameter combinations that an app supports for prediction.

5. Donate the intent when appropriate
  - Create an instance of the intent class (this is automatically generated for you from the Intent file via an Xcode rule)
  - donate it

```swift
// Donate your intent.

let intent = CheckWeatherIntent()
intent.location = weatherLocation

let interaction = INInteraction(intent: intent, response: nil)
interaction.donate { (error) in
  // Handle the error.
}
```

- It's important to delete donations so people don't get suggestions for actions in your app that are no longer relevant:

```swift
// Donate your intent.
let interaction = INInteraction(intent: intent, response: response)
interaction.identifier = "68753A44-4D6F-1226-9C60-0050E4C00067"
interaction.groupIdentifier = "san-diego"
interaction.donate { (error) in
  // Handle the error.
}

// Delete individual donations.
INInteraction.delete(with: ["68753A44-4D6F-1226-9C60-0050E4C00067"]) { (error) in
  // Handle the error.
}

// Delete group donations.
INInteraction.delete(with: "san-diego") { (error) in
  // Handle the error.
}
```

## Behind the scenes

- the system stores these donations over time along with the context the person was in when the intent was donated
- As the user continue to repeat the same action, the app continues to make intent donations
- The system uses the intent parameters to determine whether the intents are equivalent or not
- The system uses machine learning and on-device intelligence to find patterns in the data and predict what intent is relevant given a person's current context and past behavioral patterns
- The on-device intelligence integrates with user-facing features to expose your app's capabilities and presence to the user
- all of the machine learning and intelligence is performed on-device in a privacy-preserving manner, meaning Apple does not collect any data that can be used to personally identify a user

## What makes a great donation?

- Represents an action likely to be repeated by the user
- Intent payload is consistent across donations - so that a pattern can be recognized by the on-device intelligence 
- No timestamps (in the suggestion parameters)
