- new in iOS 15: Businesses app clips will show up in Spotlight

## App Clip card in Safari

![][appClipSafari]

- in iOS 14, we could use the `apple-itunes-app` meta tag to display the smart app banner in Safari or Safari View Controller
- new in iOS 15 we can configure the meta tag to show a full-sized App Clip Card
- if the user chooses `View in Safari`, Safari will remember the choice and not show the card next time the page is loaded again
- add `app-clip-display=card` in your meta tag:

```html
<head>
<meta name="apple-itunes-app"
      content="app-clip-bundle-id-com.example.fruta.Clip, app-id-123456789, app-clip-display=card"> 
</head> 
```

- works from another app's Safari View Controller too

## Test with local experiences

- you can test the whole app clip experience
- you can launch it with most of regular App Clip invocation methods.
- to create one local experience, go to `Developer Settings > Local Experiences`
  - Local experiences support QR, NFC, App Clip Code, Safari, and Messages
  - They don't show up in Maps, location suggestions, and Spotlight search
  - you can only specify local experiences for Xcode-installed App Clips or App Clips in Beta testing

## App Clip Code

- Apple-designed visual code
- available from iOS 14.3
- an App Clip code always leads to an App Clip
- each code encodes an unique URL
- two types: NFC-integrated or Scan-only
- can be used as an AR anchor
- you can create a code via App Store Connect or via the [App Clip Code Generator][resources] cli tool
  - See all available templates at `/Library/Developer/AppClipCodeGenerator/SampleTemplates`
  - generator command example: 

```shell
$ AppClipCodeGenerator generate --type nfc --url https://fruta.example --index 4 --output fruta.svg`
```

### Best practices

- keep the code on a flat surface
- the code should be placed at upright position (no sideways etc)
- make the code at least one-inch wide
- ensure good visibility: the code shouldn't be blocked, damaged, or placed too close to other codes
