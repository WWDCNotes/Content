## Multitasking

new APIs for scene presentation as well as enhanced state restoration.

## Scene Overview

### Configuration

The structure of a scene's components is defined by a scene configuration.

- defines scene role and delegate class
- optional attributes:
  - name
  - storyboard
  - `UIScene` subclass
- Can be declared either in the `Info.plist` or can be created at runtime

### Content

- represented by an `NSUserActivity`
- These activities are used for requesting scenes as well as for state restoration

### Scene management

- managed by a scene delegate
- the delegate is responsible for: 
  - setting up the UI
  - responding to lifecycle events
  - saving and restoring state.

### Scene tracking

- tracked by `UISceneSession`
- scenes can be disconnected and reconnected by the system when it's in the background
- the scene session tracks the scene regardless of its connection state and persists between (scene) launches

A scene session can be thought of as the representation in the system app switcher:  
Each item in the switcher corresponds to a scene session.

## Scene request options

When requesting a scene from the system, you can provide an options object for customizing the request.

- new in iPadOS 15, [`UIWindowScene.ActivationRequestOptions`][UIWindowScene.ActivationRequestOptions] offers new options subclass specifically for window scenes

- Using this subclass allows you to specify a presentation style ([`UIWindowScene.PresentationStyle`][UIWindowScene.PresentationStyle] (`.prominent`, `.standard`, `.automatic`)

### Prominent presentation

![][prominent]

- new style
- presented modally in the current workspace with the scenes behind it dimmed.
- this presentation should provide `Cancel`, `Close`, or `Done` buttons
- can be re-positioned like any other scene
- this presentation should be dedicated to specific content within your app like a document or file.
- this dedicated content scope must be defined in the scene's activation conditions ([`UISceneActivationConditions`][UISceneActivationConditions])

### Window scene activation action

- [`UIWindowScene.ActivationAction`][UIWindowScene.ActivationAction]
- to be used in menus, buttons, and bar button items
- defaults to prominent style
- provides title and image

```swift
let newSceneAction = UIWindowScene.ActivationAction({ _ in

  // Create the user activity that represents the new scene content.
  let userActivity = NSUserActivity(activityType: "com.myapp.detailscene")

  // Return the activation configuration.
  return UIWindowScene.ActivationConfiguration(userActivity: userActivity)
})

// Add the action to the menu.
let menu = UIMenu(children: [
  newSceneAction,
  flagAction,
  shareAction
])
```

- on iPhone this action is automatically hidden
- an alternate action can be provided on the `ActivationAction` initialization

### Open scenes via gesture

- requires prominent style

Two ways:

1. new `UICollectionViewDelegate` method

```swift
func collectionView(
  _ collectionView: UICollectionView,
  sceneActivationConfigurationForItemAt indexPath: IndexPath,
  point: CGPoint
) -> UIWindowScene.ActivationConfiguration? {

  // Get the item's user activity.
  guard let itemActivity = <#User Activity#> else {
    // Return nil if item can’t be opened in a dedicated scene.
    return nil
  }

  // Return the activation configuration.
  return UIWindowScene.ActivationConfiguration(userActivity: itemActivity)
}

```

2. [`UIWindowScene.ActivationInteraction`][UIWindowScene.ActivationInteraction]

```swift
// Create an activation interaction.
let newSceneInteraction = UIWindowScene.ActivationInteraction { interaction, point in
  // Get the activity for specific point in view.
  guard let userActivity = <#User Activity#> else { return nil }

  // Return an activation configuration.
  return UIWindowScene.ActivationConfiguration(userActivity: userActivity)

} errorHandler: { error in
  // Present the content in another manner.
  <#Present Content#>
}

// Add interaction to the view.
<#View#>.addInteraction(newSceneInteraction)
```

## `QLPreviewSceneActivationConfiguration`

- [`QLPreviewSceneActivationConfiguration`][QLPreviewSceneActivationConfiguration]
- special scene for displaying files
- system-managed (no need for delegate, or callbacks to worry about)

## Scene state restoration

- can restore interaction states of textfields via new [`interactionState`][interactionstate] property
- New in iPadOS 15, there's a new callback dedicated to state restoration
- `scene(_:restoreInteractionState:)`
- called after the scene is connected and the storyboard has been loaded, but before the first transition to foreground

### Extending state restoration

- iPadOS 15 allows your app to request a short-term extension
- During this extension, the launch image will remain visible while still allowing the main RunLoop to execute
- app must signal when complete (app will be terminated otherwise)

```swift
func scene(_ scene: UIScene, restoreInteractionState stateRestorationActivity: NSUserActivity) {
  guard let viewController = window?.rootViewController as? <#Expected View Controller Class#> else { return }

  // Request an extension.
  scene.extendStateRestoration()

  // Fetch content asynchronously.
  <#self.someAsyncFunction#> { result in
    <#Restore Content#>

    // Signal that state has been restored.
    scene.completeStateRestoration()
  }
}
```

## Keyboard shortcuts

- On iPadOS 15, the Mac Catalyst menu system will show as the new shortcut interface
- hold down the Command key (in an external keyboard) to display this menu
- disabled commands are hidden in iPadsOS
- includes all system commands (undo/redo included)

- to customize this, override the `buildMenu(with:)` app delegate function

## Pointer enhancements

### Multiple items selection

- new [`UIBandSelectionInteraction`][UIBandSelectionInteraction] to select multiple items on iPad (you get this for free if you're using a collection view)

```swift
// Support multi-selection using UIBandSelectionInteraction.

let selectionInteraction = UIBandSelectionInteraction { [weak self] interaction in
  guard let strongSelf = self else { return }
          
  // Handle selection by responding to interaction state.
  if interaction.state == .selecting {
    strongSelf.selectItemsInRect(interaction.selectionRect)
  } 
  else if interaction.state == .ended {
    strongSelf.finalizeSelection()
  }
}

view.addInteraction(selectionInteraction)
```

- can further select and deselect items by looking at the `initialModifierFlags` `UIBandSelectionInteraction` property 

### Pointer accessories

- ability to attach accessories to system pointers 
- provide contextual hints by combining secondary shapes with the primary pointer
- accessories are visually separate and secondary to the main pointer
- rendered differently than the main pointer, have separate animation
- can be combined with any pointer style 

### Pointer latching

- iPadOS 15 introduces the concept of `latchingAxes` on [`UIPointerRegion`][UIPointerRegion]
- e.g. a horizontally latching region lets you drag freely along the x-axis while still rubberbanding along the y-axis
