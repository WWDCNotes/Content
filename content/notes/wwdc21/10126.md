- You need an interface that stands on its own, without heavy-handed (onboarding) tutorials
- learning by doing is a lot more fun and effective than reading a list of instructions (people skip or don't remember onboarding tutorials)

Five fundamentals to make your app more discoverable:

## 1. Prioritize important features (so you can make the most important ones visible)

- essential parts of the app should be immediately visible to people
- for non-essential parts, it's ok to require navigation to reach
- make it easy to reach the parts of the app people use frequently

## 2. Provide visual cues (use words and symbols people are familiar with)

- do not use hamburger menus, people don't know what's inside (use tab bars or others)
- minimal ≠ usable and simple, too minimal means we increase the risk that people won't find features
- know your audience, will help you understand what needs to be spelled out and what can be inferred by people
- think about who is your product for
- guide with words and visuals

## 3. Hint at gestures

- making use of gestures in your app will make your app feel more fluid and responsive than navigating through with only discrete taps
- use the accepted gesture for the platform
- if you're inventing a new gesture, try to mimic real-life interactions
- use gestures as a shortcut, not a replacement
- e.g. hint to a swipe down dismissal when they user taps the back/close button by performing a sliding down animation

## 4. Organize by behavior (group content to fit people's behavior)

- use personalization
- organize content into a dedicated section that will surface suggestions from a machine-learning-powered recommendation engine
- visualize organization (e.g. by making the categories clear at a glance)

## 5. Convey a sense of control over personalized content

- let people provide explicit feedback (about the content)
- disclose implicit feedback (a.k.a. feedback we gather without people consciously asking for it, e.g. if we suggest content based on a previously purchased item)
- give control over recommendations
