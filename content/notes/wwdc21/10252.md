## Performance fundamentals 

- Diffable data source is built to store identifiers of items in your model, and not the model objects themselves

Improvements to diffable data source:

- Before iOS 15, applying a snapshot without animation would do a `reloadData` internally
- From iOS 15 onwards, applying a snapshot without animation will only apply the differences and not perform any extra work
- diffable data source also gains a new `reconfigureItems` method that makes it easy to update the contents of visible cells

### Life of a cell 

Two phases:

1. preparation
  - the collection view is asked to dequeue a new cell using a registration
  - if a cell exists in the reuse pool, `UICollectionView` will call `prepareForReuse` on it, and then dequeue the cell. Otherwise it will create a new one
  - the cell is then passed in to the configuration handler from the registration
  - the collection view queries the cell for its preferred layout attributes and sizes the cell appropriately

2. display
  - `willDisplayCell` is called on the delegate
  - the cell is made visible inside the `UICollectionView`
  - when the cell is scrolled off screen, `didEndDisplaying` is called for the cell, and it ends up in the reuse pool

### How an app updates the display

How an app produces a frame:

1. commit

  - for each frame, events such as touches are delivered to the app
  - in response, the app updates the properties of its views and layers
  - as a result of those changes, the app's views and layers perform layout

2. rendering

  - the layer tree is sent to the render server
  - each frame has a commit deadline, this is the time by which all commits for that frame need to finish
  - the amount of time an app has to commit for each frame depends on the refresh rate of the display

What is a hitch?

- when the commit for a frame takes too long and misses the deadline, those updates don't get incorporated into the intended frame
- the display keeps the previous frame on screen until the commit finishes, and this delayed frame can render
- this is a commit hitch and is perceived as a momentary interruption when scrolling

## Cell prefetching

- from iOS 15 cells are pre-fetched after finishing a short commit
- this makes them pre-ready for when they're needed

How prefetching effects the cell lifecycle:

- it is possible for a prepared cell to never be displayed, which could happen if the user suddenly changed the scroll direction
- once a cell is displayed, it can go right back into the waiting state after it goes off screen
- the same cell can be displayed more than once for the same index path

This means that a cell will not be immediately added to the reuse pool when it ends displaying.

## Updating cell content

When a cell needs to get/display remote data, we shouldn't update its content directly, as the cell might have been already reused to display other content.

- iOS 15 introduces the `reconfigureItems` snapshot method: this method will rerun the associated cells registration's configuration handler. 

```swift
private func setPostNeedsUpdate(id: DestinationPost.ID) {
  var snapshot = dataSource.snapshot()
  snapshot.reconfigureItems([id]) // 👈🏻
  dataSource.apply(snapshot, animatingDifferences: true)
}
```

- use this instead of `reloadItems`, because it reuses the item's existing cell, rather than dequeuing and configuring new cells 

Example:

```swift
// Updating cells asynchronously

let cellRegistration = UICollectionView.CellRegistration<DestinationPostCell,
                                                         DestinationPost.ID> {
  (cell, indexPath, postID) in

  let post = self.postsStore.fetchByID(postID)
  let asset = self.assetsStore.fetchByID(post.assetID)
  
  if asset.isPlaceholder {
    self.assetsStore.downloadAsset(post.assetID) { _ in
      self.setPostNeedsUpdate(id: post.id) // 👈🏻
    }
  }
  
  cell.titleView.text = post.region
  cell.imageView.image = asset.image
}
```

- to maximize prepare time, trigger downloads during the data-source prefetching.

### Image preparation APIs

- decoding and displaying images takes time
- ideally, we could prepare the image in advance and only update the UI when the image decoding is completed
- new in iOS 15, we have image preparation APIs, giving us control over where and when image preparation happens
- these APIs produce a new `UIImage`, which only contains the pixel data that the renderer needs
- two forms: 
  - synchronous, which can on any thread
  - asynchronous, which run on an internal UIKit serial queue

```swift
// Using prepareForDisplay

// Initialize the full image
let fullImage = UIImage()

// Set a placeholder before preparation
imageView.image = placeholderImage

// Prepare the full image (in the background)
fullImage.prepareForDisplay { preparedImage in
  DispatchQueue.main.async {
    self.imageView.image = preparedImage
  }
}
```

Warning:

- these prepared images are not to be stored on disk, but should be cached
- they take large amount of memory

Usage example:

```swift
// Asset downloading – with image preparation

func downloadAsset(
  _ id: Asset.ID,
 completionHandler: @escaping (Asset) -> Void
) -> Cancellable {
  // Check for an already prepared image
  if let preparedAsset = imageCache.fetchByID(id) {
      completionHandler(preparedAsset)
      return AnyCancellable {}
  }
  return fetchAssetFromServer(assetID: id) { asset in
    asset.image.prepareForDisplay { preparedImage in
      // Store the image in the cache.
      self.imageCache.add(asset: asset.withImage(preparedImage!))
      DispatchQueue.main.async {
        completionHandler(asset)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

New thumbnail API:

- use less memory and computation

```swift
// Using prepareThumbnail

// Initialize the full image
let profileImage = UIImage(...)

// Set a placeholder before preparation
posterAvatarView.image = placeholderImage

// Prepare the image
profileImage.prepareThumbnail(of: posterAvatarView.bounds.size) { thumbnailImage in
  DispatchQueue.main.async {
    self.posterAvatarView.image = thumbnailImage
  }
}
```
