> [Session sample code](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiviewcontroller/customize_and_resize_sheets_in_uikit)

- (From iOS 15) new customization options for sheets
- New support for a medium detent (and more)
  - allows to create a vertically resizable sheet that only covers half the screen
  - the dimming view can be removed, allowing to build a non-modal UI where the user can interact with content behind the sheet while the sheet is presented

## `UISheetPresentationController`

- A sheet is an instance of a new `UIPresentationController` subclass called `UISheetPresentationController`
- all customization options are exposed as properties on this class
- you get an instance of `UISheetPresentationController` by reading the `sheetPresentationController` property on a view controller before you present it
- This property will be non-nil as long the view controller's `modalPresentationStyle` is form sheet or page sheet (default)

```swift
if let sheet = viewController.sheetPresentationController {
  // Customize the sheet
}
present(viewController, animated: true)
```

## Detents

- A detent is a height where a sheet naturally rests 
- defined as a fraction of the fully expanded sheet frame 
- this is the fully expanded frame on an iPhone and iPad: 

![][detents]

- two system-defined detents: 
  - `.medium()`, which is about half of a sheet's full height
  - `.large()`, which is the height of a fully expanded sheet

- specify which detents you want a sheet to support via the `UISheetPresentationController`'s `detents` property:

```swift
if let sheet = viewController.sheetPresentationController {
  sheet.detents = [.large()] // This is the default value
}
present(viewController, animated: true)
```

## Scroll behavior

- If we have a scroll view within the sheet, scrolling on that view  will also expand the sheet
- we can opt out of this behavior, meaning that the user can only explicitly resize the sheet by dragging from the bar, by setting an extra property:

```swift
if let sheet = viewController.sheetPresentationController {
  // ...
  sheet.prefersScrollingExpandsWhenScrolledToEdge = false // 👈🏻
}
present(viewController, animated: true)
```

## Programmatically selecting a detent

We can change the current selected detent by setting the `selectedDetentIdentifier` property:

```swift
if let sheet = viewController.sheetPresentationController {
  sheet.selectedDetentIdentifier = .medium
}
```

By default it has no animation, to add one, wrap it around a `sheet.animateChanges` block:

```swift
if let sheet = viewController.sheetPresentationController {
  sheet.animateChanges {
    sheet.selectedDetentIdentifier = .medium
  }
}
```

## Dimming View

- by default all detents are dimmed
- we can change that by setting from which detent the sheet will show the dimming view

```swift
if let sheet = viewController.sheetPresentationController {
  // ...
  sheet.smallestUndimmedDetentIdentifier = .medium
}
```

This property also allows the user to interact with both the content in the sheet and with the content outside of the sheet.

## Keyboard avoidance

- medium height sheets support automatic keyboard avoidance: 
  - the sheet grows automatically to account for the keyboard
  - when the keyboard dismisses, the sheet automatically collapses back down

## Landscape

- new alternate landscape appearance where sheets are only attached to the screen at their bottom edge (no longer full screen on landscape)

![][landscape-1]

```swift
if let sheet = viewController.sheetPresentationController {
  // ...
  sheet.prefersEdgeAttachedInCompactHeight = true
}
```

- this will always give you a sheet that is as wide as the safe area
- if you'd like a sheet whose width follows the presented view controller `preferredContentSize`:

![][landscape]

```swift
if let sheet = viewController.sheetPresentationController {
  // ...
  sheet.prefersEdgeAttachedInCompactHeight = true
  sheet.widthFollowsPreferredContentSizeWhenEdgeAttached = true
}
```

## More Appearance customization

- We can display a default grabber:

```swift
if let sheet = viewController.sheetPresentationController {
  // ...
  sheet.prefersGrabberVisible = true
}
```

- We can customize the corner radius of the sheet:

```swift
if let sheet = viewController.sheetPresentationController {
  // ...
  sheet.preferredCornerRadius = 24.0
}
```

- Note that the system will keep stacked corners looking consistent: if the sheet with different radius expands to full height, the root sheet (and other stacked ones) will have a corner radius to match

## Adaption from popover

- on regular sizes Apple suggests to show a popover instead of a sheet, this popover adapts to a sheet in compact sizes:

```swift
viewController.modalPresentationStyle = .popover // popover by default
if let popover = picker.popoverPresentationController { // reach for popoverPresentationController instead of sheetPresentationController
  popover.barButtonItem = sender // the source of the popover

  let sheet = popover.adaptiveSheetPresentationController // sheet adoption
  // 👇🏻 normal sheet configuration
  sheet.detents = [.medium(), .large()]
  sheet.prefersScrollingExpandsWhenScrolledToEdge = false
  sheet.smallestUndimmedDetentIdentifier = .medium
}
present(viewController, animated: true)
```
