- Why do we test? → To discover bugs before we ship and not afterwards
- Testing is an investment, so let's maximize our returns while minimizing our costs
- New failures are valuable: indicates a flaw in product, tests or dependencies
- Ideally, new failures should be fixed fast, re-appearing failures are "noisy" though
- Disabling: Test code with compile, but reduces visibility as an issue that needs resolve
- `XCTSkip`: Builds and executes, so included in test reports, but skips some useful parts
- New `XCTExpectFailure`: test executes normally, fails as "expected", but suite passes
- Allows for adding a link in `<>` to issue tracker, test report shows a bug button to get to it
- Stateful: Add `XCTExpectFailure` to the beginning of test method, marks whole method
- Scoped: Add failing code as trailing closure to `XCTExpectFailure` only ignores that part
- Use the scoped variant for shared/reused code, such as utility code
- Possible to define `XCTExpectedFailure.Options` with `issueMatcher` to control match
- E.g. `options.isEnabled` only set on a specific platform (where it's failing)
- `XCTExpectFailure` by default is `strict` and expects a test to actually fail
- For non-deterministically flickering tests, set `isStrict` to false, has convenience parameter
- Use test repetitions to debug them, see "Diagnose unreliable code with test repetitions"
