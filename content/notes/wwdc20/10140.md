This session is mostly an introduction to how to use Core Location (see related session below) plus some tips.

## Determine device support

Before asking for authorization, check whether the current device supports the feature you're interested in:

```swift
if CLLocationManager.isMonitoringAvailable(for: CLBeaconRegion.self) {
    // Supports region monitoring to detect beacon regions
}

if CLLocationManager.isRangingAvailable() {
    // Supports obtaining the relative distance to a nearby iBeacon device
}
```

If the device doesn't support what you're interested in, offer the user a list of options (e.g. a list of locations/cafes/..)

## iBeacon

- A beacon is a device that emits a signal which can be detected by the system and passed to your app
- Those signals can identify when a user is within a certain location
- Once we detect a specific beacon signal, we can trigger something in our app.

- When deploying your beacon hardware, you must program each beacon with an appropriate proximity UUID, major value and minor value.
- The values identify each of your beacons uniquely and make it possible for your app to differentiate between them.

- Use region monitoring to detect the presence of a beacon
- Use ranging to determine the proximity of a detected beacon

```swift
// Stage 1: Region Monitoring

func monitorBeacons() {
    if CLLocationManager.isMonitoringAvailable(for: CLBeaconRegion.self) {

        let constraint = CLBeaconIdentityConstraint(uuid: proximityUUID)

		// Contains the proximity UUID, major value and minor value, of the beacons that you want to detect.
        let beaconRegion = CLBeaconRegion(
            beaconIdentityConstraint: constraint,
            identifier: beaconID
        )
        
        self.locationManager.startMonitoring(for: beaconRegion)
    }
}
```

```swift
// Stage 2: Beacon Ranging

func locationManager(_ manager: CLLocationManager, didEnterRegion region: CLRegion) {
    guard let region = region as? CLBeaconRegion,
        CLLocationManager.isRangingAvailable()
        else { return }
    
    let constraint = CLBeaconIdentityConstraint(uuid: region.uuid)
    manager.startRangingBeacons(satisfying: constraint)
    beaconsToRange.append(region)
}

func locationManager(_ manager: CLLocationManager, didExitRegion region: CLRegion) {
    ...
}

func locationManager(
    _ manager: CLLocationManager,
    didRangeBeacons beacons: [CLBeacon],
    in region: CLBeaconRegion) {
    
    guard let nearestBeacon = beacons.first else { return }
    let major = CLBeaconMajorValue(truncating: nearestBeacon.major)
    let minor = CLBeaconMinorValue(truncating: nearestBeacon.major)
    
    switch nearestBeacon.proximity {
    case .near, .immediate:
        displayInformation(for: major, and: minor)
        
    default:
        handleUnknownOrFarBeacon(for: major, and: minor)
    }
}
```
