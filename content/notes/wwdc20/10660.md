- When apps ask for permission to access user's location, a new option "Precise" has been added
    - This option is also available under Settings for your app
    - Apps cannot opt out of this feature, it's completely under user's control
    - New enum type:

```swift
enum CLAccuracyAuthorization {
    case fullAccuracy
    case reducedAccuracy
}
```

- [API changes to CLLocationManager](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanager?changes=latest_minor)
    - `locationManagerDidChangeAuthorization(_: CLLocationManager)` will get called when user change the authorization status or accuracy

- Location delivery
    - `CLLocation` objects will be sent to `didUpdateLocations`, with a center point and large `horizontalAccuracy` value
    - recomputed about 4 times per hour

- Demo of Apple Maps with "Precision: Off"
- When asking for full accuracy:
    - Option 1: navigate users to Settings app and grant full accuracy permanently.
        - This may not be desirable for users
        
    - Option 2: Ask for temporary permission to full accuracy
        - Needs to provide a "purpose key", which is defined in `Info.plist`
            - You can have multiple entries to explain why you need full accuracy
        - Once granted, full accuracy will remain for the rest of the app session

- Region monitoring won't work when precise mode is turned off
    - Send users to Settings when it makes sense

- Accuracy authorization status are synced and shared between iPhone and Apple Watch
- Best practices:
    - Adapt your app for all values of `accuracyAuthorization`
    - Background monitoring behavior will change under `reducedAccuracy`
    - Consider intentionally using `reducedAccuracy` by default

- As of iOS 13.4, users may choose to go from "while in use" to "always" without leaving the app. So it's better for developers to ask for `.authorizedWhenInUse` the first time, and only ask for `.authorizedAlways` when the user accesses a feature that needs it

- App clips
    - No Always authorization
    - "While using" becomes "while using until tomorrow"

- Widgets
    - Get location authorization from parent app, but still needs to specify a key in its `Info.plist`
