## Intelligent System Experience

What is an Intelligent System Experience?  
It's how the operating system works with the apps that people use every day to make their "every day" easier.  
It's an intelligent glue that ties together all of our devices, apps, and the operating system to make everyday stuff easier for people.

- Intelligence is a design: it's more than just Siri suggestions
- Intelligence is a platform convention: it's something enabled and reinforced by its consistent appearance on the platform
- Intelligence is expected: if your app doesn't integrate with the system intelligence, or your app smartness doesn't met the user expectation, it doesnt' matter who/what is at fault, it just doesn't feel right

## Extensibility

Apps are more than just the app icon and app itself: Apple introduced Apps extensions in WWDC 2014, then SiriKit, Shortcuts, widgets, App Clips, the list goes on.

Many of these technologies are also built to help Apple's growing ecosystem of devices, like Handoff and more.
