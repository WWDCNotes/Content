## What's new in Shortcuts on Apple Watch

- New Shortcuts.app
- on iPhone you can maintain a Apple Watch collection of all the shortcuts that should sync to the Watch
- New Shortcuts complications
  - to launch the Shortcuts.app
  - to trigger a specific shortcut

## Running Shortcuts on the Watch

For shortcuts based on `NSUserActivity` API, we need to open the app to handle the activity: 

- if the app is found on the watch, the app is launched
- if the app is not found, an error will be shown

For shortcuts based on `Intent` API, we need to call the Intent extension:

- if the extension is found on the watch, the extension will be asked to handle the intent
- if not, the watch will try to handle the intent _remotely_, aka in the phone:
  - if the intent can be handled without launching the app, it will do so
  - if the intent requires to be handled in the app, an error will be shown
