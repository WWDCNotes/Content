## Compatibility

For your app to be available in the Mac App Store, it must be compatible with the Mac:

- Your app can't be dependent on an unavailable symbols or frameworks
- It can't be dependent on missing functionality in existing frameworks
- It can't be dependent on hardware capabilities that don't exist on the Mac

## Availability

- All iOS/iPadOS apps are automatically available in the Mac app store
- You can opt out in App Store Connect

## Environment differences

### Hardware differences

- Mouse and touch events: the system automatically maps standard gestures, however you should test if your custom interactions and gestures work on Mac
- Environment sensors: make sure to check for the availability of each sensor in your app 
- Camera: to discover all available cameras (you can plug external cameras on the mac) use [`AVCaptureDeviceDiscoverySession`][AVCaptureDeviceDiscoverySession]

### UI differences

- Popups might be displayed in different places in macOS
- Open and Save panels will show in separate window
- If your iPad app already supports multitasking on iOS, it will be fully resizeable on macOS. (if not, your app will be displayed in a fixed-size window)

### System Software differences

- Filesytem: On macOS the user can move the app wherever they would like. Your app's data containers are also in a different location on the Mac. Use Foundation APIs to locate items in the filesystem.

## Distribution

- Beside the mac app store, you can also distribute your apps via ad-hoc and other methods as well
- App thinning is supported
- TestFlight is not supported on macOS
