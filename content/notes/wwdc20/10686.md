## Architecture: Intel vs. Mac

- Intel-based architecture is composed of several, separated components such as Multicore CPUs, Discrete GPUs, T2.
- Apple Silicon instead has all the components in a SoC (System on a Chip): building everything into one chip gives the system a shared memory architecture. 
- SoC CPU and GPU work in the same memory, and data can be shared efficiently, without need to copy data over a PCIe bus.
- By using Apple Silicon, new macs gain powerful components present on iDevices such as specialized video encoder and decoder, Neural Engine, Machine Learning Accelerators
- intel-based macs CPUs have multiple cores with similar performance (a.k.a. symmetric cores)
- Apple Silicon has multiple performance cores and other power efficient cores (a.k.a. Asymmetric cores architecture)

### AMP (Asymmetric MultiProcessing)

All cores support the same architectural set of features, and support the same software

### How to take advantage of the new architecture

All modern frameworks have been adopted to take advantage of the new architecture, there are no API changes specifically for Apple Silicon.

- Unified memory architecture: use `Metal`
- Video encoder and decoder: use `AVFoundation` and `VideoToolbox`
- Neural Engine: use `CoreML`
- Machine Learning Accelerators: use `CoreML`, `Accelerate`, `Compression`, `simd`
- Asymmetric multiprocessing: use `QoS` and `GCD`

## Security features

Apple Silicon brings all the iPhone/iPad/.. security features to macOS:

- [Write XOR execute (W^X)][JIT]
- Kernel Integrity Protection
- Pointer authentication
- Device isolation

### Write XOR execute (W^X)

- Memory pages cannot be both writable and executable at the same time.
- Use `pthread_jit_write_protect_np` for fast switching between RW and RX permissions
- Per-thread permission to support multi-threaded JITs

### Kernel Integrity Protection

- Apple Silicon has hardware support in the memory controller that enforces kernel immutability
- Once the kernel has been loaded into memory, Kernel Integrity Protection makes sure that Kernel pages cannot be modified, or new pages made executable

### Pointer authentication

- Pointer authentication guards against misuse of pointers and prevent memory attacks.
- Enabled for: Kernel, System applications, System services

### Device isolation

On Apple Silicon all devices use a separate [IOMMU][IOMMU], this restrict devices to memory they're only intended to (Intel macs have a shared memory for all devices)

## ApplicationsRosetta

Rosetta runs:

- macOS/Catalyst applications
- games
- Web browsers
- JIT compilers
- Metal directly on Apple GPU
- Core ML with Neural Engine

There are differences between processes running on a Intel- and Apple Silicon-based Macs:

- Memory pages sizes
- TSO memory ordering
- sleep time
- Floating point NaN, denormal handling

Rosetta will make sure that Intel-apps will see the architecture they expect

## Boot and Recovery

### Boot Overview

- On Apple Silicon Macs the boot process is based on iOS and iPadOS Secure Boot

- Secure Boot ensures that each startup component is cryptogatically signed by Apple and that the boot happens only after the verification of the chain of trust

- Added support to boot from multiple macOS install from both internal and external volumes

- enable booting any version of macOS signed by Apple

### Start-up and macOS Recovery

- Press and hold Touch ID or Power button to launch startup options, all existing start-up keys are replaced by UI interactions

#### Mac Sharing Mode

- replaces Target Disk Mode
- based on SMB file share
- user authentication is required to enable this service

#### Startup Disk
### Boot Security
### Protection layer

- focuses on selecting the security policy for each of the volume
- you can choose between full and reduced security mode.

- Full security mode is the same as security on iPhone (enabled by default)

- External volumes are supported in full security mode

- reduced security mode provides flexibility and configurability of your mac

- reduced security lets you run any version of macOS (including versions no longer signed by Apple)
- reduced security lets you install notarized 3rd party kernel extensions

- you can configure the security of your mac via [`csrutil(1)`][csrutil]

- Intel based macs have a system-wide security policy
- Apple Silicon macs have a per-OS security policy

- Login
 - CCID and PIV-compatible
 - VoiceOvere support

- Apple Silicon support Secure hibernation:
 -  Full at-rest protection
 - Integrity and anti-replay protection

 ## Recovering your Mac

 At high level, the system software is composed by two components:

 - macOS
 - macOS Recovery

If macOS is not accessible/missing, you can use macOS Recovery to install and restore the system

What happens is even macOS Recovery is not accessible?

- In Intel-based macs you can use Interet recovery
- On Apple Silicon macs you can use System Recovery:
  - Minimal macOS enviroment
  - Separate hidden container
  - Lets you re-install macOS and macOS Recovery

- You can use Apple Configurator 2 when even the System Recovery is not functional
