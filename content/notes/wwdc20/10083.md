## Introduction

Wind Down helps users meet their sleep goals, during Wind Down apps can offer shortcuts that:

- focus on the things that will let the user relax or give them some space and mindfulness after a long day. 
- get a heads-up on what is most important for tomorrow before going to bed.

During Wind Down mode, the lock screen will show a shortcuts button to show the user favorite/suggested Wind Down shortcuts. 

To create such shortcuts, either: 

- go to the Health app's new sleep setup flow.
- add any existing shortcut (from the Shortcuts.app) by going to the shortcut details view and toggle `Show in Sleep Mode`.

All these shortcuts will be available in the Shortcuts.app under the `Sleep Mode` category (this category will show up only after some shortcuts have been added to it).

## Integrate Apps actions

### Shortcut Availability

Apps can feature shortcuts in the Wind Down setup flow so they can be run with just a few taps from the lock screen. 

The main way any app can expose its Wind Down actions is through intents and user activities:  
from iOS 14 there's a new [INIntent][INIntent] (and [`NSUserActivity`][NSUserActivity]) [`shortcutAvailability`][shortcutAvailability] property which you can use to tell the system which of your app's actions should appear in the Wind Down setup.

Here are all the possible [availabilty options][INShortcutAvailabilityOptions]:

- Journaling
- Mindfulness
- Music
- Podcasts
- Prepare for Tomorrow
- Reading
- Yoga and Stretching

### Suggest or donate apps actions

There are two things you can do to enable the system to suggest your app's actions during Wind Down setup:

- Suggest shortcuts to the system that you want to feature by calling [`setShortcutSuggestions`][setShortcutSuggestions] on [`INVoiceShortcutCenter`][INVoiceShortcutCenter].

```swift
// Suggest intent

import Intents

let playSoundIntent = INPlayMediaIntent()

playSoundIntent.shortcutAvailability = .sleepMusic
playSoundIntent.suggestedInvocationPhrase = "Play sleeping songs"

let shortcut = INIShortcut(intent: playSoundIntent)
INVoiceShortcutCenter.shared.setShortcutSuggestions([shortcut])
```

- Donate the intents/activities the user does in the app

```swift
// Donating an intent

import Intents 

let playSoundIntent = INPlayMediaIntent() 

playSoundIntent.shortcutAvailability = .sleepMusic playSoundIntent.suggestedInvocationPhrase= "Play Counting Sleepy Dinosaurs" 

let interaction = INInteraction (intent: playSoundIntent, response: nil) 
interaction. donate { error 
  // Handle the error
}
```

```swift
// Donating an user activity

import Intents 
import UIKit 

let userActivity = NSUserActivity(activityType: "your.app.domain.id.playSound" 

userActivity.isEligibleForSearch = true
userActivity.isEligibleForPrediction = true

userActivity.title = "Play Running Water"
userActivity.suggestedInvocationPhrase = "Play Running Water"
userActivity.shortcutAvailability = .sleepMusic 

viewController.userActivity = userActivity 
```
