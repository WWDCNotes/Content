## Hitches
* Scrolling animation sometimes appears to jitter, those jitters in Xcode are called hitches
* A hitch is a frame that is displayed on the screen later than it’s expected
	![][image-1]
* iPhones and iPads have screens with 60Hz refresh rate, iPad Pros go up to 120Hz. The 60Hz means that each frame should stay on screen for 16.67ms, 120Hz means 8.33ms
* VSYNC is what usually manages swapping frames on screen, we see a hitch when a frame misses its expected VSYNC 

## Hitch Metrics
* Hitch time: Time in ms that a frame is late to display
* Hitch ratio: Hitch time in ms per second for a given duration (for a test, scroll event or transition)
* Hitch time isn’t accurate as the desired screen refresh rate isn’t alway 60 or 120fps, it can be perfectly fine for VSYNC to swipe zero frames for an idle screen
* This is why we use Hitch ratio, it’s consistent across different cases and tests

### User impact targets for hitch ratio:

> You should always aim to have \<= 5ms/s hitch ratio

## Measuring Hitches
* It’s possible to measure hitches in development and production environment (production for iOS 14 only) using different tools:
	![][image-3]
* XCTest Metrics is used to measure hitches in development environment, while MetricKit and Xcode Organizer can show you measures from the customers devices directly
* XCTest Metrics has many tests you can use to measure different parts of your application, the one we’re concerned with here is `XCTOSSignPostMetric`
* `XCTOSSignPostMetric` used to measure animation duration in previous versions of Xcode, new in Xcode 12, this metric will provide 5 additional information:
	* Total count of hitches
	* Total duration of hitches
	* Hitch time ratio
	* Frame rate
	* Frame count
* To collect these metrics, you should write a test case that collects `os_signpost` intervals with the new 
* In Xcode 11, this produced a non-animation `os_signpost` intervals:
	```swift
	os_signpost(.begin, log: logHandle, name: "performInterval")
	os_signpost(.end, log: logHandle, name: "performInterval")
	```
* Now in Xcode 12, you can use the `.animationBegin` instead to specify the extra metrics related to animation:
	```swift
	os_signpost(.animationBegin, log: logHandle, name: "performAnimationInterval")
	os_signpost(.end, log: logHandle, name: "performAnimationInterval")
	```

* You can also use one of the predefined `UIKit` instrumented intervals for testing around navigation transitions and scrolling, these are sub-metrics provided on the XCTOSSignpostMetric class.
	```swift
	extension XCTOSSignpostMetric {
		 open class var navigationTransitionMetric: XCTMetric { get }
		 open class var customNavigationTransitionMetric: XCTMetric { get }
		 open class var scrollDecelerationMetric: XCTMetric { get }
		 open class var scrollDraggingMetric: XCTMetric { get }
	}
	```

* Here is a sample test case that launches the app, taps on _”Meal Planner"_ and measures the scrolling animation in a `.fast` velocity:
	```swift
	// Measure scrolling animation performance using a Performance XCTest
	func testScrollingAnimationPerformance() throws {
		app.launch()
		app.staticTexts["Meal Planner"].tap()
		let foodCollection = app.collectionViews.firstMatch
		
		measure(metrics: [XCTOSSignpostMetric.scrollDecelerationMetric]) {
	    	foodCollection.swipeUp(velocity: .fast)
		}
	}
	```

* To avoid swiping between different content in the 5 iterations of the measure block, we can reset the application state during measurements:
	```swift
	func testScrollingAnimationPerformance() throws { 
		app.launch()
		app.staticTexts["Meal Planner"].tap()
		let foodCollection = app.collectionViews.firstMatch

		let measureOptions = XCTMeasureOptions()
		measureOptions.invocationOptions = [.manuallyStop]
	    	
		measure(metrics: [XCTOSSignpostMetric.scrollDecelerationMetric],
	        	options: measureOptions) {
	    	foodCollection.swipeUp(velocity: .fast)
	    	stopMeasuring()
	    	foodCollection.swipeDown(velocity: .fast)
		}
	}
	```

#### Tips for creating performance tests:
* Create a separate test scheme for your Performance XCTest
* Use `Release`  Build Configuration and uncheck Debug executable
* Switch off Automatic Screenshots and Code Coverage
* Turn off all diagnostic options, checkers, sanitizers and memory management
