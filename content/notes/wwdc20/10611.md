1. Location anchors
2. Scene geometry
3. Depth API
4. Object placement
5. Face tracking improvements

## 1. Location Anchors
Up to this point, Apple has:
- Introduced shared AR experiences
- Brought people into AR with motion capture/people occlusion.

Now, location anchors allow us to create AR content with a longitude, latitidue, and altitude. That AR content is then placed in a real world location using Apple Maps. This is more accurate than possible with GPS due to advanced on-device Machine Learning.

This is all bundled in a new AR tracking configuration called `ARGeoTrackingConfiguration`. Geo-referenced AR content can then be added with `ARGeoAnchor`s.

Here's an example of virtual art in front of the Ferry Building in San Francisco. This sculpture is bound to a location anchor.

![][geo_sculpture]

### How does this work?
When using geo-tracking, Apple downloads detailed map data for the user's region. Part of this is a localization map that contains feature points of the surrounding area that can be seen from the street.

The user's current location, known "street view" data, and camera feed are passed into an on-device ML engine.

**This is much better in video form because they have great animations. Watch 3:55-4:25.**

### Location Anchor API
There's 3 main parts:

- `ARGeoTrackingConfiguration` enables all the location anchor features. This configuration contains a subset of world-tracking features that are compatible with geo-tracking.
- After starting an AR session with `ARGeoTrackingConfiguration`, we'll be able to create `ARGeoAnchor` objects. This works like any other ARKit anchor.
- `ARGeoTrackingStatus` provides valuable feedback to improve the geo-tracking experience. **Developers should monitor this status!**

To build a location anchor app, we need to:

1. Check if geo-tracking is available.
2. Add location anchors.
3. Use the rendering engine to place virtual content.
4. Handle geo-tracking state transitions that may need user intervention.

### Checking geo-tracking availability
Devices must have the A12 Bionic chip or newer, as well as GPS. The user must also be in an area where Apple Maps has sufficient data to start a geo-tracking session.

Lastly, we need permissions for the camera and precise location.

```swift
// Check device support for geo-tracking.
guard ARGeoTrackingConfiguration.isSupported else {
  // Geo-tracking not supported on this device.
  return
}

// Check if current location is supported for geo-tracking.
ARGeoTrackingConfiguration.checkAvailability { (available, error) in
  guard available else {
    // Geo-tracking not supported at current location.
    return
  }

  // Run ARSession.
  let arView = ARView()

  // RealityKit defaults to `ARWorldTrackingConfiguration`,
  // so we need to specify a geo-tracking configuration.
  arView.session.run(ARGeoTrackingConfiguration())
}
```

### Adding location anchors
`ARGeoAnchor` takes a longitude, latitude, and altitude. Altitude isn't necessary, and Maps can fill in "ground level". **It's important to use 6 or more decimal places in longitude/latitude.**

Let's add an anchor at the Ferry Building. For this example, we can just look up coordinates in the Maps app and let ARKit figure out the altitude:

```swift
// Create coordinates.
let coordinate = CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 37.795313, longitude: -122.393792)

// Create location anchor.
let geoAnchor = ARGeoAnchor(name: "Ferry Building", coordinate: coordinate)

// Add location anchor to session.
arView.session.add(anchor: geoAnchor)

// Create a RealityKit anchor entity.
let geoAnchorEntity = AnchorEntity(anchor: geoAnchor)

// Anchor content under the RealityKit anchor.
geoAnchorEntity.addChildl(generateSignEntity())

// Add the RealityKit anchor to the scene.
arView.scene.addAnchor(geoAnchorEntity)
```

This is what we get:

![][ferry_building_demo]

We want to be able to spot the Ferry Building from a distance, assuming we're inside the city. We want the text to face the city, not be rotated. We also want the text to float a few meters in the air so it can be seen better.

### Positioning content
`ARGeoAnchor`s are fixed to cardinal directions. Their axes are set on creation, and they remain unchanged for the rest of the session. The `x` axis always points East, the `y` axis always points up, and the `z` axis always points South.

![][coordinate_system]

Like all other anchors, `ARGeoAnchor`s are immutable. This means we need to use the rendering engine to transform or translate anchors from their origins.

```swift
// Create a new entity for our virtual content.
let signEntity = generateSignEntity()

// Add the virtual content entity to the Geo Anchor entity.
geoAnchorEntity.addChild(signEntity)

// Rotate text to face the city. The rotation angle is clockwise by a little less than 90 degrees.
let orientation = simd_quatf.init(angle: -Float.pi / 3.5, axis: SIMD3<Float>(0, 1, 0))
signEntity.setOrientation(orientation, relativeTo: geoAnchorEntity)

// Elevate text to 35 meters above ground level.
let position = SIMD3<Float>(0, 35, 0)
signEntity.setPosition(position, relativeTo: geoAnchorEntity)
```

Now, our text is higher in the air and much easier to read from a distance:

![][ferry_building_demo_improved]

This is nice, but we're still missing some crucial information about the geo-tracking state that can ensure a great experience for the user.

### Geo-tracking state transitions
When using the geo-tracking configuration, there's a new geo-tracking status object called `ARGeoTrackingStatus`, which is available on `ARFrame` and `ARSessionObserver`. This is similar to the `ARWorldTrackingStatus` available on `ARCamera`.

This object contains:

- A state that indicates how far along geo-tracking is during localization.
- A reason for the current state.
- An accuracy once geo-tracking localizes.

When an `ARSession` begins, `ARGeoTrackingState` starts at "Initializing". At this point, geo-tracking is waiting for world-tracking to initialize.

From this point, if geo-tracking isn't available in the current location, the state can immediately go to "Not available". We can usually avoid this state if we first check for availability.

Once geo-tracking moves to "Localizing", ARKit receives images and Maps data and tries to compute pose. However, during both "Initializing" and "Localizing" states, there could be issues that prevent localization. `ARGeoTrackingStateReason` contains reasons for these issues. Some possible reasons:

- `.devicePointedTooLow`: Tell the user to raise the device.
- `.geoDataNotLoaded`: Tell the user that a network connection is required.

For all possible reasons, look at `ARGeoTrackingTypes.h`.

In general, we want to encourage users to point devices at buildings and other stationary structures that are visible from the street. Parking lots, fields, and other dynamic areas have a lower chance of localizing.

After addressing any geo-tracking state issues, geo-tracking should become "Localized" and we can start our AR experience. Starting before this point could mean that objects jump to unintended locations.

Additionally, once geo-tracking is "Localized", accuracy information is available to help guage which experiences should be enabled.

**It's important to always monitor `ARGeoTrackingState` because it's possible to move back to "Localizing" or "Initializing"**. For example, tracking could be lost or map data could no longer be available.

Jump to 13:30-13:40 to see the localization process.

### Authorizing location anchors
Our app may get coordinates from our backend, but it's also possible to have users tap the screen to save their own point of interest. `ARSession.getGeoLocation(forPoint:)` allows us to get geographic coordinates for any point in ARKit coordinate space. This can come from a raycast or a location on a plane.

```swift
let session = ARSession()
let worldPosition = raycastLocationFromUserTap()
session.getGeoLocation(forPoint: worldPosition) { (location, altitude, error) in
  if let error = error {
    // Handle error...
  }

  let geoAnchor = ARGeoAnchor(coordinate: location, altitude: altitude)
}
```

### Location anchor availability
Location anchors are available today in iOS 14 in major US cities:

- San Francisco Bay Area
- New York
- Chicago
- Miami

More cities are coming throughout the summer.

Devices must be an iPhone or iPad with A12 Bionic or newer and GPS capability.

For any apps that require location anchors exclusively, developers can limit visibility in the App Store with capability keys:

```plist
<key>UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities</key>
<array>
    <string>gps</string>
    <string>iphone-ipad-minimum-performance-a12</string>
</array>
```

## 2. Scene Geometry
ARKit 3.5 introduced the Scene Geometry API powered by the LiDAR scanner on the new iPad Pro.

![][lidar_scanner]

As a recap, the LiDAR scanner shoots light onto the surroundings and collects light reflected off of surfaces in the scene. Depth is estimated by measuring the time it took the light to reflect off the environment and hit the scanner again. This process runs millions of times per second.

The Scene Geometry API provides a topological map of the environment. This can be optionally fused with semantic classification, which enables apps to recognize and classify physical objects.

Together, these capabilities enable occlusion with virtual objects. They also enable realistic interactions between virtual and physical objects. Lastly, they can enable virtual lighting on real surfaces.

![][scene_geometry]

**To see scene geometry in action, jump to 17:10-17:37 (it's cool!)**

## 3. Depth
Scene geometry is built by leveraging depth data from the LiDAR scanner and on-device Machine Learning. In iOS 14, there is a new ARKit depth API that provides access to a dense depth image. In the depth image, each pixel corresponds to a depth in meters from the camera. These images are captured at the same rate as `ARFrame`, i.e. 60 fps.

Below is a debug image where blue is closer to the camera and red is farther away:

![][depth_debug]

### Accessing depth data
In iOS 14, each `ARFrame` has a new property `sceneDepth`, which provides an `ARDepthData` object. This is a container for 2 buffers: a depth map, and a confidence map.

The depth map is a `CVPixelBuffer`, where each pixel represents a depth in meters. This depth corresponds to a distance from the camera to a point in the world. **Note that this map has a smaller resolution than `ARFrame.capturedImage`, but still preserves the aspect ratio.**

The confidence map provides a confidence level for the depth of each pixel. This is necessary because the accuracy of depth is impacted by the surrounding environment. Challenging surfaces, such as highly reflective or highly absorbant surfaces, can lower accuracy. Each value is of type `ARConfidenceLevel` and can be `.low`, `.medium`, or `.high`.

### Using the depth API
There is a new frame semantic called `sceneDepth`, which allows us to turn on the depth API:

```swift
let session = ARSession()
let configuration = ARWorldTrackingConfiguration()

// Check if configuration and device supports `.sceneDepth`.
if type(of: configuration).supportsFrameSemantics(.sceneDepth) {
  // Activate sceneDepth.
  configuration.frameSemantics = .sceneDepth
}

session.run(configuration)
```

We can then access the depth data in an `ARSessionDelegate` method.

```swift
// Accessing depth data.
func session(_ session: ARSession, didUpdate frame: ARFrame) {
  guard let depthData = frame.sceneDepth else { return }
  // Use depth data.
}
```

Additionally, in AR apps with people occlusion, there is another API that provides both depth and people occlusion:

```swift
let session = ARSession()
let configuration = ARWorldTrackingConfiguration()

// Build the set of required frame semantics.
let semantics: ARConfiguration.FrameSemantics = [.personSegmentationWithDepth]

// Check if configuration and device supports the required semantics.
if type(of: configuration).supportsFrameSemantics(semantics) {
  // Activate `.personSegmentationWithDepth` + `.sceneDepth`
  configuration.frameSemantics = semantics
}

session.run(configuration)
```

### Point Cloud Demo App
To see a demo of a 3D point cloud app (also really cool!), jump to 21:25-22:25.

A key part of this app is a Metal vertex shader called `unproject`. This unprojects the depth data from the 2D depth map into 3D space. It also uses data from `ARCamera` and `capturedImage` to get a 3D point cloud, which is rendered using Metal.

![][point_cloud_demo_app]

### Recap: Depth

- ARKit 4 introduces a new depth API
- There's a new frame semantic called `sceneDepth` which enables depth data
- Depth (and confidence) data is available at 60Hz
- Available on LiDAR devices

## 4. Object Placement
ARKit 3 introduced the raycasting API to make object placement easier. ARKit 4 uses the LiDAR scanner for more quicker and more precise raycasting. In iOS 14, raycasting is recommended over hit-testing.

### Anatomy of a raycast
Raycasting requires a raycast query, which describes the behavior and directions of the ray used for raycasting. It is composed of:

- A raycast target, which describes the type of surface that the ray can intersect with.
  - Existing planes are detected by ARKit, taking into account the size and shape of the plane.
  - Infinite planes have no size or shape.
  - Estimated planes are planes of arbitrary orientation formed from feature points around a surface.

- A target alignment: horizontal, vertical, or any.

There are 2 types of raycasts:

1. Single, short raycasts. These are for one-time results.
2. Tracked raycasts. As the name suggests, these are tracked continuously as ARKit's understanding of the world evolves.

### Migrating from hit-testing to raycasting

In order to get the latest features for object placement, developers should migrate to raycasting.

```swift
// Hit-testing is deprecated:
arView.hitTest(
  point, 
  types: [
    .existingPlaneUsingGeometry, 
    .estimatedVerticalPlane, 
    .estimatedHorizontalPlane
  ]
) 

// Simplified object placement using raycasting: 
let query = arView.makeRaycastQuery(
  from: point, 
  allowing: .estimatedPlane.,
  alignment: .any
)!

let raycast = arView, session.trackedRaycast(query) { results in
  // result updates
}
```

## 5. Face Tracking
Face tracking allows us to detect faces from the front camera, overlay virtual content, and animate facial expressions in real-time. This is supported on all devices with the TrueDepth camera.

ARKit 4 brings face tracking support to devices without a TrueDepth camera as long as they have an A12 Bionic processor or later.
