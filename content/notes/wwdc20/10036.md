## URL Sessions

- the `TimelineProvider` API is built with completion handlers instead of return values, specifically to make doing asynchronous tasks, like network fetches, easy
- we can use normal URL sessions end even background session tasks.
- since the widget has no app delegate, there's a new `View` modifier, introduced just for widgets, to handle background URL sessions: [`.onBackgroundURLSessionEvents(matching:_:)`][bgSessionDoc]

## Link

- use SwiftUI's [`Link`][linkDoc] to make elements of the widget deep link into your app.
- `Link` behaves like `Button`, but instead of passing an `action`, we pass a `destination` `URL` which will be passed to the app on launch.
- to read the URL in your views, use the [`.onOpenURL(perform:)`][onOpenDoc] modifier

## Widget bundles

- In order to create/support multiple widgets in the same extension, we need to define a [`WidgetBundle`][wbDoc]
- The `WidgetBundle` will be the new entry point of the extension
- The `WidgetBundle` declares all available widgets in its body (up to 5 widgets)

```swift
@main
struct EmojiRangerBundle: WidgetBundle {
    @WidgetBundleBuilder
    var body: some Widget {
        EmojiRangerWidget()
        LeaderboardWidget()
    }
}
```

## Dynamic configuration

- if we don't know all of the configuration options at build time, we can provide a dynamic list of options via an SiriKit `Intent` extension, the same way we would for other Intent-based features
- to create a SiriKit extension, go to `File > New Target` and choose `Intents Extension`.
- in our `Intent` editor we will set our Intent type to something custom (in the screenshot above we set it to `Hero`):

![][customTypeImage]

- if we look at the definition of our custom type, by default it has two properties: `identifier` and `displayString`:

![][customTypeImage2]

- these properties are defined in our Intent extension:

```swift
class IntentHandler: INExtension, DynamicCharacterSelectionIntentHandling {
    
    func provideHeroOptionsCollection(for intent: DynamicCharacterSelectionIntent,
                                      with completion: @escaping (INObjectCollection<Hero>?, Error?) -> Void) {
        let characters: [Hero] = CharacterDetail.availableCharacters.map { character in
            let hero = Hero(identifier: character.name, display: character.name)
            
            return hero
        }
        
        let remoteCharacters: [Hero] = CharacterDetail.remoteCharacters.map { character in
            let hero = Hero(identifier: character.name, display: character.name)
            
            return hero
        }
        
        let collection = INObjectCollection(items: characters + remoteCharacters)
        
        completion(collection, nil)
    }
    
    override func handler(for intent: INIntent) -> Any {
        return self
    }
}
```

- lastly, we will need to update our `IntentTimelineProvider` to support our dynamic configuration
