## Menus

* In iOS 14, you can show a Menu from any button
* Menus in iOS consist of:
  * Label-icon actions
  * A title
  * Separators

* Do not add a Cancel button inside a menu, simply tapping outside the menu does the same effect

* The menu adheres to the system accessibility settings by default

### Menus use cases:

1. Disambiguation: when you want to clear out what is the user's intent for this action
2. Navigation: giving extra options to navigate backward or forward
3. Selection: to select one option of many for actions like Sort and Filter
4. Secondary options: to show non-primary actions that are not important enough to be prominently displayed, but still should have easy access

* Do not hide all actions under one menu, instead, carefully promote your primary actions and group together secondary ones, if needed:

* You can make your buttons do one thing on tap, and another (showing a menu) on long press
* If there is a destructive action in your menu, make sure to always use an action sheet on iPhones, and pop-overs on iPad, to take the user confirmation before doing the action:

## [`UIDatePicker`][UIDatePickerDoc]

![][image-6]

* New `UIDatePicker` can show date picker only, time picker only, or both.
* You can instruct the `UIDatePicker` to style itself for a `.compact` space, where it will display only a small key color on top of a light platter:

Tapping on that key would present the date/time picker in a modal style
* `UIDatePicker` also adhere to the system’s accessibility settings

## UIColorPickerViewController

![][image-8]

* You can use `UIColorPickerViewController ` to pick a color in of 4 different ways:
	* Grid
	* Spectrum
	* Sliders
  * Eyedropper from anywhere on the screen
  
* Picked colors are saved for the user to use them across apps
