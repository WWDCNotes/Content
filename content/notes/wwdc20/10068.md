## Design

- in iOS 14 Siri comes with a notification-like, compact design
- The new design focuses only on the most essential information, minimizing disruption

- The same design also comes to Shortcuts.app
- in iOS 13 you may have needed to jump into the Shortcuts.app to complete a task: with iOS 14 shortcuts will run seamlessly in the background, and will only prompt you if the shortcut needs your input

## Shortcuts: intents principles

### Disambiguation

a.k.a. when you're asking follow-up questions to clarify the user's intent

- With conversational shortcuts, you have the opportunity to ask follow-up questions, with iOS 14 there are new APIs for customizing how the list is presented:

### Intents UI

a.k.a. how your app UI shows in Siri and Shortcuts.

- Your Intents UI now appears in this new compact UI, whether you're running from Siri or Shortcuts:

- Intents UIs now use a consistent background material whether they're run from Siri or from Shortcuts:
 - take advantage of the new material by keeping the background color of your Intents UI view transparent.

- focus on the essentials:
  - Because the compact UI appears on top of whatever the user is doing, the less vertical space your Intents UI takes up, the more lightweight the experience will feel.

## Shortcuts Folders

- users can now create folders for their shortcuts
- there are smart folders to identify which shortcuts appear in the share sheet or on the watch.

## Shortcuts on Apple Watch
