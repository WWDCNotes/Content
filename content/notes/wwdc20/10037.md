## `View`s, [`Scene`][scene]s, and [`App`][app]s

- Beside `View`s, from this year SwiftUI can declare `Scene`s and `App`s

- `View`s are the basic building blocks, rendering everything on screen. `View`s can be composed with other `View`s.

- `View`s form the content of a `Scene`, making them platform-independent

- `Scene`s can also be composed with other `Scene`s (think of tabs on macOS)

- `Scene`s form the content of an `App`

### Example

```Swift
@main
struct MyApp: App {
    @StateObject private var store = Store()

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            MyView(store: store)
        }
    }
}
```

- In thie example we have an `App`, `MyApp`, which contains a `Scene`, [`WindowGroup`][wg], which contains a view `MyView`.

- Above the struct declaration we have a new Swift 5.3 attribute [`@main`][main], which declares this `struct` as the entry point of our programs execution.

- Declaring `App`s is very similar to declaring `View`s: both comform to a protocol (`App` vs `View`), and both need to define a `body` (of type `some Scene` vs `some View`).

- Like `View`s, also Apps can declare data depenencies, and in this example `MyApp` declares to be owner of the `store` object by using the `StateObject` property wrapper,

## [`WindowGroup`][wg]

- Scene that allows us to define the primary interface of our app.

- `WindowGroup` is a scene that allows our app to automatically create multiple scenes containing `MyView` when needed (this works for having multple windows on both iPad and mac).

- Like in UIKit, an app can provide a shared model for each scene to use, but the state of the views in those scenes will be independent.

- `WindowGroup` also manages tabs for us on macOS.

- [`@SceneStorage`][scenestore] is a new property wrapper that manages scenes restoration.

## More New features

- [`DocumentGroup`][docg]: New scene that help us with document based apps, more on this in `Build Document-Based Apps in SwiftUI` session.

- [`Settings`][sett] is a macOS-only scene used for declaring apps preferences

- The [`Commands`][cmd] API (along with the `[.commands`][cmdm] modifier) let us describe commands to be shown in the main menu on macOS and key commands on iOS.
