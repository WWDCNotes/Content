## Design principles

- watch apps should be lightweight
- limit interactions/features
- make actions discoverable

## Design process goals

1. Interactions should be both discoverable and predictable.
2. Relevant actions should always be visible. 
3. Eliminate gesture-based contextual menus without removing functionality.

## Secondary Actions

Secondary actions add or increase functionality, provide a secondary but still important action and/or provide new ways to interact with the primary actions already in the view.

### Sort and filter actions

Sort and filter menus are a lightweight and actionable way to narrow down any long list and make it easier to navigate and more relevant to you in the moment.

Use a `Picker` inside a `List` to show such action:

![][sortImage]

```swift
List {
    Picker(selection: $viewing
           title: Text("Viewing")) {
       // Viewing options
    }
    // Rest of the list 
}
```

### Swipe actions

Swipe actions are being used more and more in watchOS for displaying actions in a list.

Use the `.onDelete` modifier on a List to remove rows via a swipe:

![][deleteImage]

```swift
List {
    ForEach(model.locations) {
        ClockCell(location: $0)
    }
    .onDelete { deleteClock(index: $0) }
}
```

### More options

- It's especially important to separate primary from secondary actions when you think about using a More button
- Never put primary actions inside a More menu
- Be very choosy about which secondary actions you offer

![][moreImage]

Use a simple circular container element with the SF Symbol ellipsis centered inside. Refer to Apple's [Human interface Guidelines][watchHIG] for the recommended hit regions for each watch screen size and add transparent padding around your button, if needed, to ensure that your button is comfortably tappable.

![][oneMoreImage]

If you'd like to show only one more extra action, you can do so by showing an ad-hoc glyph.

### Bottom of a scroll view actions

![][bottomButtonImage]

- Action buttons at the bottom of a detail view may be the most discoverable and intuitive way to show actions in your app
- The actions at the bottom of a detail view should always apply to the content of the view above it
- To avoid confusion, information in the detail view that is not actionable sits directly on the black background
- Only the action button at the bottom sits in a container and looks tappable
- Use a red text label on the button to indicate a destructive action
- Add a confirmation alert if the information being deleted is not easily retrievable

### Toolbar buttons

![][toolbarImage]

- These buttons are hidden by default, and show up only after the user swipe down
- Use tool bar buttons only for actions that are essential to the functioning of your app but may not be the primary action for the view
- Use toolbar buttons only on scrollable views

```swift
.toolbar {
    Button(action: newMessage) {
        Label("New Message", 
              systemImage: "square.and.pencil")
    }
}
```

### Hierarchycal Navigation

- In a hierarchical navigation model, the app should remember the destination the user chose the next time they open the app.
