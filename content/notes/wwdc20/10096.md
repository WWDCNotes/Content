- In Xcode 12 Playgrounds gained easy support for package dependencies
- If we have our own package, we can use a playground to showcase and document our library API in a playground

## Using Xcode Playground with Frameworks and Packages Dependencies

- As long as the Playground and the Package or framework are in the same workspace, we can make these dependencies available to the playground by enabling the Playground Settigns `Build Active Scheme` in the Playground Inspector.
- `Build Active Scheme` tells Xcode to automatically build all targets in the currently selected scheme and make any modules (frameworks/packages) importable to the Playground.
- New Playgrounds have this `Build Active Scheme` enabled by default.

## What Else is New in Playgrounds

- Playgrounds build logs are now available in the report navigator.
- All resource types supported by the build system are now supported in Playgrounds, which means things such as Assets Catalogs and `.mlmodel`s are now supported.
