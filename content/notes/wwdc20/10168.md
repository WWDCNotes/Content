## New Logging APIs

* Record events as they happen
* Archived on device for later retrieval
* Low performance overhead

### Adding Logs Steps:

1- Import the `os` framework
```swift
import os
```

2- Define a logger object with a `subsystem` identifier that helps in identifying that the message is coming from your app, and a `category` string that differentiates between messages coming from different parts of your app.
```swift
let logger = Logger(subsystem: "com.example.Fruta", category: "giftcards")
```

3- Add the logging action
```swift
logger.log("Started a task")
```

And that's it.

`log` function behaves similar to a `print` statement, but it doesn't convert logs into `String`s like `print` does, it optimizes the printed logs based on the type of logged data.

You can log anything that is:
* A numeric type like `Double` and `Int`
* Objective-C objects with `-description`
* Any type that conforms to `CustomStringConvertible`


Be aware that nonnumeric types are redacted from the log output, to make sure that no personal information are mistakenly logged. To explicitly mark those types as safe to log, you can pass the optional parameter `privacy` as such:
```swift
logger.log("Ordered smoothie \(smoothieName, privacy: .public)")
```

## Retrieving Logs

You can retrieve the logs by plugging the device into your mac and running the command:
```
log collect --device --start '2020-06-22 9:41:00' --output fruta.logarchive
```

> Logs are streamlined into the Console.app when your device is connected to your mac

## Log Levels

Those are the available logging levels sorted in an increasing order of their importance:

| Log Level | Description | Persistence |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Debug | Useful only during debugging | Not persisted |
| Info | Helpful but not essential for troubleshooting | Persisted only during `log` collect |
| Notice (default) | Essential for troubleshooting | Persisted up to a storage limit |
| Error | Error seen during execution | Persisted up to a storage limit |
| Fault | Bug in program | Persisted up to a storage limit |

* Not persisted or deleted logs can't be accessed later on. You can access not persisted logs only while streamlining logs directly from the device

* As the log level increases, the performance of that logging decreases, so `Debug` is the most performant log level, while `Fault` is the least performant

* Because of the previous point, logging very slow functions at the `Debug` level is safe because the compiler will make sure those aren't executed when the debug messages are discarded

## Formatting Logs

`Logger` offers many APIs that you can use to format your logs, for example:
```swift
statisticsLogger.log(
    """
    \(taskID) 
    \(giftCardID, align: .left(columns: GiftCard.maxIDLength)) 
    \(serverID) 
    \(seconds, format: .fixed(precision: 2))
    """
)
```

* Formatting data has no cost at run-time
* There are many other [formatting APIs][formattingDoc] and [alignment options][alignmentDoc]
* It's very important to remember that you shouldn't log any private information, you can use the `hash` option as a parameter to the privacy level of your logs to indicate the data existence without actually revealing it, like so:
```swift
logger.log("Paid with bank account: \(accountNumber, privacy: .private(mask: .hash))")
```
> This produces an output like follows:
```
Paid with bank account <mask.hash:'Csf11hACSI24GHca4sf8178er=='>
```

## API Availabality

iOS 14, tvOS 14, watchOS 7, and macOS Big Sur:
* New Logger APIs
* New `os_log()` overloads that accept string interpolations

Prior releases:
* Older `os_log()` overloads accept format strings
