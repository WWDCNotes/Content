- Swift Playgrounds on Mac is the same app as in iPadOs thanks to Catalyst.

## Code completion in macOS vs. iPadOS

## Customizing content for each platform

### Device availability

In the playground book document format we have two new optional keys:

- In `Manifest.plist`:
  - `SupportedDevices` (array): `iPad` and/or `Mac`.
  - `RequiredCapabilites` (array): possible values defined in [`UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities`][reqDoc]. 

- In `feed.json`:
  - `supportedDevices`: same as above 
  - `requiredCapabilites`: same as above

By setting any of these, the book will only show up on devices that met those requirements.

`RequiredCapabilites` is more flexible than `SupportedDevices` as we can specify exactly which capabilities our book required.

### Code availability

Instead or requiring a specific capability such as `arkit`, you can also use the `#if targetEnvironment()` compilation conditional block to customize content for each platform, for example:

```swift
#if !targetEnvironment(macCatalyst)
// Code to exclude from Mac.
#endif
```

## Respecting platform settings

When creating something for all platforms, instead of using [`liveViewSafeAreaGuide`][liveViewSafe], use [safeAreaLayoutGuide][safeGuide], because there are different layouts/overlays in iPadOS and macOS.
