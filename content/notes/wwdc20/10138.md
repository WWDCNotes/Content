- Apple provides in-depth beta documentation and release notes that are focused on IT admin workflows

- Test plans and survey are provided to ensure the newest features work in your existing environment
- The surveys are so you can help Apple better understand that environment
- this is for you to provide your unique feedback on mission-critical apps and services that are important to your employees

- Apple is most interested in:
  - feedback about deployment blockers
  - issues that would prevent you from deploying the latest OS when we release it
  - regressions
