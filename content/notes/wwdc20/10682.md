> Swan's Quest is a series of challenges where each chapter has a specific programming challenge for you that will build on the prior chapters.

Download the `.playgroundbook` [here][swdwl]. 

## Tones

For this first challenge, a `SPCAudio` `PlaygroundModule` has been built, this module is part of the [Create Quest][createQuestDwl] Playground Book.

In this challenge you will need to play a tone with the secret code given in the previous quest. All of this is done via a `Timer` and a `SPCAudio`'s' `Tone`.

## Solution

### Advice from the Lizard

```swift
let toneOutput = ToneOutput()

func performance(owner: Assessable) {
    
    let tones = [
        Tone(pitch: 440.00, volume: 0.3),
        Tone(pitch: 493.88, volume: 0.3),
        Tone(pitch: 523.25, volume: 0.3) 
    ]
    
    var toneIndex = 0
    Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: 0.4, repeats: true) { timer in
        guard toneIndex < tones.count else {
            toneOutput.stopTones()
            timer.invalidate()
            owner.endPerformance()
            return
        }
        
        toneOutput.play(tone: tones[toneIndex])
        toneIndex += 1
    }
    // Let it be known your performance has ended.
    owner.endPerformance()
}
```

### Performance at Swan Hall

```swift
func performance(owner: Assessable) {
    let toneOutput = ToneOutput()
    
    // TODO: Code your performance here.
    let tones = [261.63, 293.66, 329.63, 349.23, 392.00, 440.00, 493.88, 523.25].map({ Tone(pitch: $0, volume: 0.3)})
    
    var toneIndex = 0
    Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: 0.4, repeats: true) { timer in
        guard toneIndex < tones.count else {
            toneOutput.stopTones()
            timer.invalidate()
            owner.endPerformance()
            return
        }
        
        toneOutput.play(tone: tones[toneIndex])
        toneIndex += 1
    }
    
    // Let it be known your performance has ended.
    owner.endPerformance()
}
```
