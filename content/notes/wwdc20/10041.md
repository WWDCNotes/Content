## 100% SwiftUI Apps
We can now build an entire app completely in SwiftUI.

This is a fully functional app:

```swift
@main
struct HelloWorld: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            Text("Hello, world!").padding()
        }
    }
}
```

- We can do so thanks to the new [`App`][appDoc] protocol, which requires a `body` of type [`some Scene`][sceneDoc].
- [`WindowGroup`][winDoc] lets us create scenes easily based on the platform, and more.
- [`DocumentGroup`][docDoc] lets us open, edit, and save document-based scenes.

## LaunchScreen
- New `Launch Screen` `Info.plist` key
- Lets us declare standard UI components such as images, navigation bar, tab bar, background colors as the app launch screen. 
- Replaces the `LaunchScreen.storyboard`.

## Widgets
- Built exclusively with SwiftUI
- Widgets are just like Views, however instead of conforming to `View`, they conform to the [`Widget`][widgetDoc] protocol, and the `body` returns a [`some WidgetConfiguration`][wiConf] instance. 

## Apple Watch
- We can use SwiftUI to build custom complications

## Lists
- Stacks behave more like `List` by prepending them with with Lazy (e.g. [`LazyVStack`][lazyvstack])
- New grid component via [`LazyHGrid`][lazyHGrid], [`LazyVGrid`][lazyVGrid], and [`GridItem`][GridItem]

## Toolbar and Controls
- New [`.toolbar`][tbDoc] modifier and [`ToolBarItem`][tbitem], those are examples of **semantic placements**, we describe to SwiftUI the role that these toolbar items have, and SwiftUI will automatically place them properly.
- We can also specify the placement in the `ToolBarItem` explicitly in its initializer

- [`Label`][labelDoc]
    - new View that combines a text and an image (in reality `Label` accepts two `AnyView` instances)
    - `Label`s adapt neatly based on the context and dynamic type size, sometimes the text might not be shown (for example on navigation bars)

- [`ProgressView`][proViewDoc]
    - can display determinant and indeterminate progress
    - linear and circular style
    - customizable

- [`Gauge`][gaugeDoc]
    - used to display a value relative to a range (min/max)

- Other important modifiers
    - `.help`
    - `.keyboardShortcut`

## Effects and Styling
- [`matchedGeometryEffect`][mgeDoc]
- [`ContainerRelativeShape`][crsDoc]
- We can add a new `AppAccentColor` color assets in our bundle to have our app automatically adapt that accent color in all our UI.
- We can also customize some parts of our UI with a different color than the app accent color by using the relative tint modifier such as [`listItemTint`][lit]

## System Integration
- The new [`Link`][lv] view lets open a webpage or deep link to another app, this is the equivalent of creating a button with a `UIApplication.shared.open` action
- drag and drop support
- [`SignInWithAppleButton`][signIn]
- More integrations:
    - AVKit
    - MapKit
    - SceneKit
    - SpriteKit
    - QuickLook
    - HomeKit
    - ClockKit
    - StoreKit
    - WatchKit
