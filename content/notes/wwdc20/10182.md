## Tracking Symptoms

30 Symptoms data types have been added to Health Kit this year, they are shown below.

## Electrocardiogram (ECG)

ECG samples can now be read as an [`HKElectrocardiogram`][hkElectroDoc]. `HKElectrocardiogram` represents a collecton of voltage measurements. The class contains the following properties:

- [`classification`][classDoc] - can report if the user is in [Atrial fibrillation][afWiki] or not.
- [`symptonStatus`][syDoc] - is one of the tracking symptoms mentioned above.
- [`averageHeartRate`][avgDoc]
- [`samplingFrequency`][samplDoc]
- [`numberOfVoltageMeasurements`][voltDoc] - is the number of measurements that make up an ECG measurement.

If you want individual measurements you have to run the [`HKElectrocardiogramQuery`][queryDoc]:

## Mobility

6 minute walk test, stair ascent and descent speed, walking speed and step length can now be measured by your phone and/or watch. Walking speed and step length are captured by the walking asymmetry and double support percentage
