## Tracking Symptoms

30 Symptoms data types have been added to Health Kit this year, they are shown below.

![][symptoms]

## Electrocardiogram (ECG)

ECG samples can now be read as an [`HKElectrocardiogram`][hkElectroDoc]:

```swift
/// Represents a collection of voltage measurements.
class HKElectrocardiogram: HKSample {
  var classification: HKElectrocardiogram.Classification 
  var symptomsStatus: HKElectrocardiogram.SymptomsStatus 
  var averageHeartRate: HKQuantity? 
  var samplingFrequency: HKQuantity? 
  var number0fVoltageMeasurements: Int 
}
```

Here's the description and documentation reference for such properties:

- [`classification`][classDoc]: reports whether if the user is in [Atrial fibrillation][afWiki] or not.
- [`symptomsStatus`][syDoc]: tells us whether the user has any associated a symptom when this ECG was recorded.
- [`averageHeartRate`][avgDoc]: user’s average heart rate during the ECG.
- [`samplingFrequency`][samplDoc]: the watch sample frequency during the ECG.
- [`numberOfVoltageMeasurements`][voltDoc]: the number of measurements that make up this ECG.

If you want individual measurements you have to run the [`HKElectrocardiogramQuery`][queryDoc]:

```swift
// Query 
class HKElectrocardiogramQuery: HKQuery {
  public enum Result {
    case measurement(HKElectrocardiogram.VoltageMeasurement)
    case error(Error)
    case done 
  }

  public convenience init(
    _ ecg: HKElectrocardiogram, 
    dataHandler: @escaping (HKElectrocardiogramQuery, HKElectrocardiogramQuery.Result) -> Void
  )
}
```

## Mobility

New set of mobility types:

- walking speed and step length
- walking asymmetry and double support percentage
- stair ascent and descent speed
- six minute walk test
