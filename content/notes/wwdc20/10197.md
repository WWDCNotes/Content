- Siri Event Suggestions are now also on macOS Big Sur and on the simulator

## What is Siri Event Suggestions?

- Makes it easy to get your event from your app into Calendar
- The system uses on-device intelligence to streamline everyday interactions with your events: 
  - on the lock screen, Siri can notify you when it's time to leave for a restaurant reservation, based on local traffic conditions. 
  - on Maps, you get a Siri Suggestion, making getting directions to the airport to catch a flight is as easy as just one tap.
  - Siri can also proactively suggest turning on Do Not Disturb, so you can stay focused on what matters, like the movie you're about to watch.
  - Siri can even provide a suggestion to check-in for your flight right on your lock screen.

## New categories and platforms

Previously:

- Restaurants booking
- Car rentals
- Train
- Movies
- Lodging
- Ticketed Events
- Flights

New:

- Bus
- Boat

## New ways to donate events

Beside apps you can now donate events with Mail.app and Safari.app:  
to do you need to embed the event web markup within the HTML of your website or emails.

- leverages a web standard called [schema.org][schema]
- supports both JSON-LD and Microdata

JSON-LD example:

```xml
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "http://schema.org",
  "@type": "FoodEstablishmentReservation",
  "reservationStatus": "http://schema.org/ReservationConfirmed",
  "reservationId": "IWDSCA",
  "partySize": "2",
  "reservationFor": {
    "@type": "FoodEstablishment",
    "name": "EPIC Steak",
    "startDate": "2020-06-26T19:30:00-07:00",
    "telephone": "(415)369-9955"
    "address": {
      "@type": "http://schema.org/PostalAddress",
      "streetAddress": "369 The Embarcadero",
      "addressLocality": "San Francisco"
      "addressRegion": "CA",
      "postalCode": "95105",
      "addressCountry": "USA"
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

Microdata example:

```xml
<div itemscope itemtype="FoodEstablishmentReservation"> 
  <link itemprop="reservationStatus" href="http://schema.org/ReservationConfirmed"/>
  <meta itemprop="reservationId" content="IWDSCA"/>
  <meta itemprop="partySize" content="2"/>
  <div itemprop="reservationFor" itemscope itemtype="FoodEstablishment">
    <meta itemprop="name" content="EPIC Steak"/>
    <meta itemprop="startDate" content="2020-06-26T19:30:00-07:00"/>
    <meta itemprop="telephone" content="(415)369-9955"/>
    <div itemprop="address" itemscope itemtype="PostalAddress">
      <meta itemprop="streetAddress" content="369 The Embarcadero"/>
      <meta itemprop="addressLocality" content="San Francisco"/>
      <meta itemprop="addressRegion" content="CA"/>
      <meta itemprop="postalCode" content="95105"/>
      <meta itemprop="addressCountry" content="USA"/>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

- As long as the reservation identifier stays the same, we can use the same markup format to update the event as well.
- If the event gets canceled, update the `reservationStatus` to `http://schema.org/ReservationCancelled`

### Requirements

- you must register your domain at [developer.apple.com][developer.apple.com] where you can submit your domain and samples of your markup.
- your website must use HTTPS, and that your emails have a valid DKIM signature.

### Testing

To enable your domain for testing, either:

- open the Developer Settings and enable `Allow Any Domain on iOS`
- use the command below on the Mac:

```
defaults write com.apple.suggestions SuggestionsAllowAnyDomainForMarkup -bool true
```

To enable local testing, either:

- open the Developer Settings and enable `Allow Unverified Sources`
- use the command below on the Mac:

```
defaults write com.apple.suggestions SuggestionsAllowUnverifiedSourceForMarkup -bool true
```

### Guidelines

- Use appropriate `reservationStatus`
- Use `ISO8601` format for dates and time
- Keep `reservationId` consistent for updates and canceled reservations

## Donations overview

![][overviewImage]

- To donate to Siri, the app first maps its reservation details into [`INReservation`][INReservation] objects.
- `INReservation` contains the details about the reservation shown in the app.
- The `INReservation` objects are added to an intent response that, together with the intent, forms the interaction, [`INInteraction`][INInteraction], that the app donates to Siri.
- Once donated, Siri may create one or more Calendar events and notify the user that the reservations were added to their Siri Event Suggestions Calendar.
- To get more details, or to manage the reservation, we want people to easily get back into your app, so we put a "Show in App" button right in Calendar to make this easy.
- When the "Show in App" button is pressed, the system will construct an [`INGetReservationDetailsIntent`][INGetReservationDetailsIntent] containing information about the reservation the user wants to view.
- This `INGetReservationDetailsIntent` uses the container and item reference from the donation that was used to create the event.
- A reservation may consist of one or more parts. For example, in a flight reservation with multiple legs, each leg is one part of the reservation and must be represented as an individual `INReservation` object with a unique `item reference`. 
![][itemReferenceImage]

- You can choose any identifier you'd like, as long as it's unique and it enables you to find a specific part of the reservation to show when being launched
- if the booking consists of one part only, like a dinner, you can use the reservation number as item reference
- if the booking consists of multiple parts, like a round-trip flight, each flight/leg needs to have its own unique item reference (for example the ticket number)

- if the app is not installed on a device, instead of the "Show in App" button there will be a "Show in Safari" button: pressing this will open the URL you set in Safari, so the user can view their reservation details on your website.
- Make sure you adopt this new URL property, since calendar events will be synced to all the users' devices, some of which may not have your app installed.

## Debugging Donations

When your app/website/email donates reservation details, they may be processed asynchronously by different parts of the system: it's not always possible to let your app know if something went wrong. 

To help you debug issues during development, you can view donation logs in the Console.app (needs Big Sur):

- select the device you're debuggin
- filter by `siri-event-suggestions` category
- donate again
