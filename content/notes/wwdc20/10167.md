Managing pointers safely means knowing all the different ways they can be unsafe.

## Levels of safety

![][levels_of_safety]

| Level of safety | Swift API                      | Description                                                                                                              |
|-----------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Safe            | `collections`, `slices`, `iterators` | Safe code. It's recommended write code at the highest safety level possible. **Not using pointers at all is a great strategy for code safety.**                                             |
| Unsafe          | `UnsafePointer<T>`               | UnsafePointer lets use pointers without worrying about type safety. |
| Raw             | `UnsafeRawPointer`               | UnsafeRawPointer lets you work with raw memory as a sequence of bytes.                                                   |
| Mutable type    | Memory-binding APIs            | Swift provides a few APIs for binding memory to types.                                                                     You're taking all the responsibility for pointer type safety. |

### Safe Swift code

![][safe_swift_code]

* Safe code isn't necessarily correct code but it does behave predictably.
* The compiler will catch the error if a programming error can lead to unpredictable behavior.
* Runtime checks guarantee the error will make the program crashes immediately.
* Safe code is really about error enforcement.

### Unsafe Swift code

![][unsafe_swift_code]

* Testing provides helpful diagnostics, but depends on the level of safety.
* Unsafe standard library APIs have assertions and debug builds that catch certain kinds of invalid input.
* Adding own preconditions to verify unsafe assumptions is a good practice.
* Sanitizer Diagnostics are great to pinpoint bugs, but don't catch all undefined behavior.
* When errors are not uncovered during testing they can lead to unexpected runtime behavior, the worst thing is corrupting or losing data.

## Pointer Safety
### Pointer's unsafe reason 1

![][pointer_lifetime_1]
![][pointer_lifetime_2]

* It needs a stable memory location before creating a pointer.
* The stable memory location has a limited lifetime - the memory location might not in the current stack frame or the memory gets deallocated directly.
* Any behavior is undefined, if a pointer accesses an invalid memory address.

### Pointer's unsafe reason 2

![][pointer_object_boundary]

* A memory location can fit in multiple objects. For example, a 64-bit memory can fit in two `Int32` type objects.
* Pointers are allowed to move to different memory addresses by adding offsets to the pointer.
* Adding or subtracting too large to the pointer, might access to the different object. 
* Accessing a pointer that has exceeded its object's boundary is undefined.

### Pointer's unsafe reason 3

![][pointer_type_1]
![][pointer_type_2]

* Pointers have their own types, they're different from the types of values in memory.
* If the pointer we have is a type of `Int16`, then we overwrite the memory location to store a `Int32` object, the pointer type will be inconsistent.
* Accessing the old pointer of type `Int16` is undefined behavior.

#### Pointer type bugs
* Different versions of complier can cause different program behavior.
* May cause unexpected behavior.
* May remain hidden for a long time.
* May be exposed at surprising times:
	* By safe-looking source change.
	* By a compiler update.

## Swift type-safe pointers
### Pointer type rules for Swift and C

* C has rules for "strict aliasing" and "type punning".
* Swift pointers can be used safely without knowing C rules.
* Swift pointers safely interoperate with C because they are, at minimum, as safe as C pointers. 
* In exchange, you need to take responsibility for object lifetime and object boundaries. 
* You can learn more in the [Unsafe Swift](https://github.com/skhillon/WWDC-Notes/blob/safe-pointers/content/notes/10648) talk.

### `UnsafePointer<T>` is a *typed pointer*

![][type_safe_pointer]

* In C, it's common to cast pointers to different types with both pointers continuing to refer to the same memory.
* `UnsafePointer<T>` only reads values of that type from memory.
* `UnsafeMutablePointer<T>` only reads or writes values of that type.
* It's undefined behavior in Swift to access a pointer whose type parameter does not match its memory location's bound type.
* Pointer types are enforced at compile time by Swift's type system.

### Pointers to variables

![][pointer_to_variables]

* Declare a variable of type int, then ask for a pointer, will get back a pointer to int.

### Pointers to arrays

![][pointer_to_arrays]

* Array storage is bound to the array element type.
* Asking for a pointer into array storage gives back a pointer to the arrays element type.

### Type-safe direct memory allocation

```swift
func directAllocation<T>(t: T, count: Int) {
    let tPtr = UnsafeMutablePointer<T>.allocate(capacity: count)
    tPtr.initialize(repeating: t, count: count)
    tPtr.assign(repeating: t, count: count)
    tPtr.deinitialize(count: count)
    tPtr.deallocate()
}
```

![][type_safe_memory_allocation]

* Allocate memory directly by calling the static allocate method on `UnsafeMutablePointer`.
* Allocation binds memory to its type parameter and returns a typed pointer to the new memory.
* Use the pointer to initialize memory only to the correct type. 
* In the initialized state, memory can be reassigned.
* De-initialize memory using the same typed pointer. Then can be safe to de-allocate.

### Composite types in memory

![][composite_type]

* Generally won't have two active pointers to the same memory location that disagree on the type.
* It's able to either get a pointer to the outer struct or a pointer to its property, they are both valid at the same time. 

## Swift *raw* pointers

* `UnsafeRawPointer` lets you refer to a sequence of bytes without specifying the type. 
* You take control over memory layout.

### Loading bytes with `UnsafeRawPointer`

![][loading_bytes_with_raw]

* It's able to interpret bytes as typed values. 
* It's always possible to cast from a typed pointer down to a raw pointer. 
* Operations on raw pointer only see the sequence of bytes in memory. 
* It's able to ask that raw pointer to load any type. 

#### Example

![][loading_bytes_with_raw_example]

* Call `.load(as: UInt32.self)` on a `Int64` pointer.
* It loads the lower 4 bytes from the memory location.
* Then it interprets the 4 bytes as a `UInt32` value.
* From a two's compliment number to an unsigned number.

### Storing bytes with `UnsafeMutableRawPointer`

![][storing_bytes_with_raw]

* Storing bytes is asymmetric with loading because it modifies the in-memory value. 
* Storing raw bytes does not de-initialize the previous value in memory. 
* To make sure the memory doesn't contain any object references.

#### Example

![][storing_bytes_with_raw_example]

* Call `.storeBytes(of: u, as: UInt32.self)` extracts 4 bytes from a `UInt32` value `u`, writing them into the upper 4 bytes of an in-memory `Int64` value.
* The typed pointer `iBytes` that already points to the in-memory value can still be used to access it, but with different value.
* Cannot cast a raw pointer back into a typed pointer because it conflicts with the memories bound type.
* In this case, `Int64` pointer overlaps with `UInt32` pointer.

### Raw pointers to variables

![][raw_pointer_to_variables]

* `UnsafeRawBufferPointer` is a collection of bytes, just like `UnsafeBufferPointer` is a collection of typed values.
* Buffer count is the size and bytes of the variables type.
* The collection index is a byte offset. (It's same as array arithmetic in C.)

### Raw pointers to mutable storage

![][raw_pointers_to_mutable]

* `withUnsafeMutableBytes` gives a collection of mutable bytes, so you can store `UInt` values and specific byte offsets.

### Raw pointers to arrays

![][raw_pointers_to_arrays]

* `withUnsafeBytes` method exposes the raw storage for the array elements.
* The buffer size is the array's count multiplied by the element stride.
* Some of those bytes could be padding for element alignment. (Data alignment)

### Raw pointers to `Data`

```swift
import Foundation

func readUInt32(data: Data) -> UInt32 {
    data.withUnsafeBytes { (buffer: UnsafeRawBufferPointer) in
        buffer.load(fromByteOffset: 4, as: UInt32.self)
    }
}

let data = Data(Array<UInt8>([0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]))
print(readUInt32(data: data))
```

* Foundation's `data` type is a collection of bytes. 
* `withUnsafeBytes` method exposes the underlying raw pointer for the duration of a closure. 
* Here we read the bytes start from offset 4, interprets as `UInt32`.

### Allocating raw storage

```swift
func rawAllocate<T>(t: T, numValues: Int) -> UnsafeMutablePointer<T> {
    let rawPtr = UnsafeMutableRawPointer.allocate(
            byteCount: MemoryLayout<T>.stride * numValues,
            alignment: MemoryLayout<T>.alignment)
    let tPtr = rawPtr.initializeMemory(as: T.self, repeating: t, count: numValues)
    // Must use the typed pointer ‘tPtr’ to deinitialize.
    return tPtr
}
```

![][allocate_raw_strorage]

* Using `UsafeMutableRawPointer.allocate` to directly allocate raw memory.
* Should compute the memory size and alignment in bytes.
* Memory state is neither initialized nor bound to a type after raw allocation.
* Specify the type of values to initialize memory. 
* `tPtr` is a typed pointer.
* Use typed pointer to de-initialize.
* There's no way to de-initialize with a raw pointer.
* The allocation doesn't care if memory is bound to a type or not.

#### Example: Contiguous storage for different types

```swift
func contiguousAllocate<Header>(header: Header, numValues: Int) -> (UnsafeMutablePointer<Header>, UnsafeMutablePointer<Int32>) {
    let offset = MemoryLayout<Header>.stride
    let byteCount = offset + MemoryLayout<Int32>.stride * numValues
    assert(MemoryLayout<Header>.alignment >= MemoryLayout<Int32>.alignment)
    let bufferPtr = UnsafeMutableRawPointer.allocate(
            byteCount: byteCount, alignment: MemoryLayout<Header>.alignment)
    let headerPtr = bufferPtr.initializeMemory(as: Header.self, repeating: header, count: 1)
    let elementPtr = (bufferPtr + offset).initializeMemory(as: Int32.self, repeating: 0, count: numValues)
    return (headerPtr, elementPtr)
}
```

![][allocate_raw_storage_example_1]

* We want to store unrelated types in the same contiguous block of memory. (As the image shows, we have type named `Header` and `Int32`.)
* `bufferPtr` is a raw pointer to a contiguous block of bytes. (It points to the first byte of the memory space.)

![][allocate_raw_storage_example_2]

* Initialize first few bytes of memory to the type of `Header`.

![][allocate_raw_storage_example_3]

* Initialize the remaining bytes to `Int32`.

This storage allocation technique is great for implementing standard library types like `set` and `dictionary`.

In general raw pointers are a kind of power tool that are good for implementing high-performance data structures, but we don't want to expose them too much.

#### Use case: decoding byte buffers
The more likely case where you want to use a raw pointer is when you have a buffer of bytes that's externally generated, and you want to decode those bytes into Swift types. 

![][raw_pointer_use_case]

* Read a descriptor to determine the sizes and types of subsequent data.
* Load the following data then decode to whatever type we want.


## Mutable type

* API names refer to the memory's 'bound type':
	* `assumingMemoryBound(to:)`
	* `bindMemory(to:capacity:)`
	* `withMemoryRebound(to:capacity:)`
* Can introduce undefined behavior or existing uses of typed pointers.
* Rule: every typed pointer access must agree with memory's bound type.

### `assumingMemoryBound(to:)`

#### Recovering a typed pointer

```swift
func takesIntPointer(_: UnsafePointer<Int>) { /* elided */ }

struct RawContainer {
    var rawPtr: UnsafeRawPointer
    var pointsToInt: Bool
}

func testContainer(numValues: Int) {
    let intPtr = UnsafeMutablePointer<Int>.allocate(capacity: numValues)
    let rc = RawContainer(rawPtr: intPtr, pointsToInt: true)
    // ...
    if rc.pointsToInt {
        takesIntPointer(rc.rawPtr.assumingMemoryBound(to: Int.self))
    }
}
```

* `RawContainer.rawPtr` holds raw memory.
* ⚠️ Use `assumingMemoryBound(to: T.self)` when memory is already bound to 'T' by a previous operation.

#### Pointing to tuple elements

```swift
func takesIntPointer(_: UnsafePointer<Int>) { /* elided */ }

func testPointingToTuple() {
    let tuple = (0, 1, 2)
    withUnsafePointer(to: tuple) { (tuplePtr: UnsafePointer<(Int, Int, Int)>) in
        takesIntPointer(UnsafeRawPointer(tuplePtr).assumingMemoryBound(to: Int.self))
    }
}
```

* `withUnsafePointer` gives back a pointer `tuplePtr` to the tuple type which is incompatible with `UnsafePointer<Int>` type.
* Memory bound to a tuple is also bound to its element types.
* Construct a raw pointer deliberately erasing the type of tuple pointer.
* Use `assumingMemoryBound` to create a pointer to `Int`. 
* Homogeneous tuples have guaranteed layout. (one value after another)
* ⚠️ Tuples with different types have no layout guarantee.

#### Pointing to struct properties

```swift
func takesIntPointer(_: UnsafePointer<Int>) { /* elided */ }

struct MyStruct {
    var status: Bool
    var value: Int
}

func testPointingToStructProperty() {
    let myStruct = MyStruct(status: true, value: 0)
    withUnsafePointer(to: myStruct) { (ptr: UnsafePointer<MyStruct>) in
        let rawValuePtr =
                (UnsafeRawPointer(ptr) + MemoryLayout<MyStruct>.offset(of: \MyStruct.value)!)
        takesIntPointer(rawValuePtr.assumingMemoryBound(to: Int.self))
    }
}
```

* `MyStruct` has an integer property. 
* `withUnsafePointer` gives a typed pointer to `myStruct`.
* By casting the struct pointer down to a raw pointer and adding that byte offset, we get a raw pointer to the value property.
* A property's memory is always bound to the properties declared type so it's safe to call `assumingMemoryBound` to to get a pointer to an `Int`.
* ⚠️ Struct layout is not guaranteed - rawValuePtr only points to a single pointee.

**Simple alternative way:**

```swift
func takesIntPointer(_: UnsafePointer<Int>) { /* elided */ }

struct MyStruct {
    var status: Bool
    var value: Int
}

let myStruct = MyStruct(status: true, value: 0)
    takesIntPointer(&myStruct.value)
}

```

### `bindMemory(to:capacity:)`
* `bindMemory` API lets you change memories bound type. 
* If the memory location was not already bound to a type, It just binds the type for the first time. 
* If the memory is already bound to a type then it rebinds the type. 

```swift
func testBindMemory() {
    let uint16Ptr = UnsafeMutablePointer<UInt16>.allocate(capacity: 2)
    uint16Ptr.initialize(repeating: 0, count: 2)
    let int32Ptr = UnsafeMutableRawPointer(uint16Ptr).bindMemory(to: Int32.self, capacity: 1)
    // Accessing uint16Ptr is now undefined
    int32Ptr.deallocate()
}
```

**Changing the bound type of a memory region:**

* Modifies the abstract memory state
* Reinterprets the memory region's raw bytes in place
* Invalidates existing typed pointers
* Can be undefined for variable, array, and collection storage
* Facilitates low-level implementation of Swift - note application code

### `withMemoryrebound(to:capacity)`
 
Temporarily changing the bound type.

```swift
func takesUInt8Pointer(_: UnsafePointer<UInt8>) { /* elided */ }

func testWithMemoryRebound(int8Ptr: UnsafePointer<Int8>, count: Int) {
    int8Ptr.withMemoryRebound(to: UInt8.self, capacity: count) {
        (uint8Ptr: UnsafePointer<UInt8>) in
        // int8Ptr cannot be used within this closure
        takesUInt8Pointer(uint8Ptr)
    }
    // uint8Ptr cannot be used outside this closure
}
```
* `withMemoryrebound(to:capacity)` gives a pointer that's guaranteed to be valid for the scope of its closure.

### Using `bindMemory(to:capacity:)` safely
* `withMemoryrebound(to:capacity)` limitations:
	* Requires a pointer to the original type
	* Both types require the same stride
* To call `bindMemory(to:capacity:)` directly, follow the same principles:
	* Limit pointer use to a controlled scope
	* Rebind memory back to the original type when the scope ends

### Memory-binding APIs

* `assumingMemoryBound(to:)`
	* Recover a type-erased pointer type
	* ⚠️ Requires prior knowledge of the memory's bound type state
* `bindMemory(to:capacity:)`
	* Global change to the memory's bound type state
	* ⚠️ Low-level operation that invalidates existing typed pointers
* `withMemoryrebound(to:capacity)`
	* Temporarily change memory's bound type state
	* ⚠️ Useful for calling C APIs that disagree on types

### Safely reinterpreting bytes
```swift
❌
let uint32Ptr = rawPtr.bindMemory(to: UInt32.self)
return uint32Ptr.pointee
```

* Call `bindMemory` to get a pointer of the type it wants to read.
* But in the process of creating that pointer we've changed memory state and probably invalidated other pointers.

```swift
✅
return rawPtr.load(as: UInt32.self)
```

* Avoids changing the in-memory type and invalidating other pointers
* Type-safe: only layout compatibility matters
* A typed pointer can be cast to a raw pointer
* `withUnsafeBytes` provides a raw buffer for variables, arrays, or Data objects

### Layering types on top of raw memory

Let's say you want to view a region of memory as a sequence of elements with a specific element type, but the underlying storage is exposed as a raw pointer and may be viewed as different types by different parts of the code.

You could easily create a wrapper around that raw pointer to preserve your element type. 

```swift
struct UnsafeBufferView<Element>: RandomAccessCollection {
    let rawBytes: UnsafeRawBufferPointer
    let count: Int

    init(reinterpret rawBytes: UnsafeRawBufferPointer, as: Element.Type) {
        self.rawBytes = rawBytes
        self.count = rawBytes.count / MemoryLayout<Element>.stride
        precondition(self.count * MemoryLayout<Element>.stride == rawBytes.count)
        precondition(Int(bitPattern: rawBytes.baseAddress).isMultiple(of: MemoryLayout<Element>.alignment))
    }

    var startIndex: Int { 0 }

    var endIndex: Int { count }

    subscript(index: Int) -> Element {
        rawBytes.load(fromByteOffset: index * MemoryLayout<Element>.stride, as: Element.self)
    }
}

func testBufferView() {
    let array = [0,1,2,3]
    array.withUnsafeBytes {
        let view = UnsafeBufferView(reinterpret: $0, as: UInt.self)
        for val in view {
            print(val)
        }
    }
}
```

## Summary
* Try to avoid using pointers
* Avoid using typed pointers to reinterpret memory as different types
* Use `UnsafeRawBufferPointer` to:
	* Reinterpret raw bytes as different types
	* Decode Swift types from a byte stream
	* Implement a container to hold different types in contiguous memory
