- By making our widget configurable, users can create multiple different instances of the same widget, each with a different configuration.
- Adding configuration to our widget allows the system to better predict times to display your widget in a stack.

## Basics

### Widget Extension

- contains SwiftUI code that renders the visual appearance of the widget. 
- contains some metadata about the widget itself.

### Widget Configuration

- When our widget is configurable, we can specify which options to user can configure on the backside of the widget
- The system will display our widget configuration for us. 
- The widget user configuration are composed by parameters.
- We use Intents to define which parameters are shown. These intents are the same as used in Siri and Shortcuts. 
- An Intent contains an ordered list of parameters.
- Each parameter in our Intent will show up as a row in the widget configuration UI. 
- We declare Intents in Xcode using an Intents definition file. 
- This file contains all of your Intents, their parameters, and indicates which parts of the system they support.
- By compiling this file into our app, the system will be able to read information about our Intents. 
- Xcode will also generate an Intent class for us, containing a property for each parameter:

```swift
class ViewRecentPurchasesIntent: INIntent {
  var card: Card?
  var category: Category?
}
```

Kind of supported configurations: 
- `String` (the widget UI will show a text field)
- `Bool` (the widget UI will display a toggle)
- Integers (number fields and steppers)
- Decimals (number fields and sliders)
- Contact pickers
- Location pickers
- Enumerations (will display a list of possible cases, both static and dynamic enumerations are supported)
- Date Picker
- Duration
- Url
- Measurement
- Currency amount
= Payment method

## How to add a configuration to your widget

The session shows how to add a configuration to an intent, this is done via the intent editor and it's several steps around enabling an intent in our Widget, it starts at 7:00 and continues to 15:00. It's very visual: it's better to watch the video for this part.

## Configuration experience

We can customize the appearance of the backside of our widget:

- [`.configurationDisplayName(_:)`][confDisplNameDoc] on the widget declaration to customize the title
- [`.description(_:)`][descDoc] on the widget declaration to customize its title

- we can define a `AccentColor` color asset in the Widget assets catalog for the Widget accent color, the name of the color asset has to added into the widget extension's build settings for `Global Accent Color Name`
- we can define a `WidgetBackground` color to set the widget background color, the name of the color asset has to added into the widget extension's build settings for `Widget Background Color Name`.

## System Intelligence

### How do Stacks behave intelligently?

The system will try to surface widgets based on two reasons: 
- User behavior
- Relevance Information

#### User Behavior 

- Based on how frequently the user uses our app
- In iOS 12, Apple introduced the concept of Shortcuts and custom Intent donations, which provides a way for the system to understand what people do in our app, the same intents will be used by the system to predict when it's time to show our widget. 

#### Relevance information from the app

- Our widget can tell the system that it has a highly relevant update
- A timeline entry has three components: 
  - a date timestamp that determines when this entry should be rendered
  - the view that should be rendered
  - the relevance of the entry. 

- The [relevance][timeEntryRelDoc] has two fields: a `score` and a `duration`.
  - Score:
    - The score indicates how relevant an entry is compared to all entries provided in the past (by us). 
    - The score range is up to us, as the system only considers the score in relation to other entries.
    - Use `0` or a negative number to tell the system that the widget has no relevant information and should not be surfaced

  - Duration:
    - Used for situations where we have a well defined period of time, where the relevant score will be fixed. 
    - Leave the duration to `zero` to tell the system that the relevant score will last until the next timeline entry relevance is received.
