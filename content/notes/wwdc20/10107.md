## Pencil vs hand drawing

- New (iOS 14 only) system settings for users to choose if they would like to draw only with the pencil or with fingers as well.
- All apps need to respect that, if you have your own drawing engine, check [`UIPencilInteraction.prefersPencilOnlyDrawing`][prefersPencilOnlyDrawing]
- This can also be toggled directly on the tool picker:

- [`PKCanvasView`][PKCanvasView] has been updated to reflect this preference with the new [`drawingPolicy`][drawingPolicy], these are the possible values/behaviors:
  - `anyInput`: allows drawing on the canvas from any input source
  - `pencilOnly`: pencil touches are the only input that draw on the canvas
  - `default`:
    - if the tool picker is displayed, it follows `UIPencilInteraction.prefersPencilOnlyDrawing`
    - if the tool picker is hidden, it's the same as `pencilOnly`

- If you'd like to hide the `Draw with Finger` option in the tool picker (for example when your app is a pencil-only app) set the [`PKToolPicker.showsDrawingPolicyControls`][showsDrawingPolicyControls] to `false`.

- You can also create your own `PKToolPicker` instances:
  - Need to be retained by your app
  - Each toolpicker can be used with different states with different canvases

## Strokes Access

- PencilKit in iOS 14 provides access to strokes, for more, check session [`Inspect, modify, and construct PencilKit drawings`][20-10148]
