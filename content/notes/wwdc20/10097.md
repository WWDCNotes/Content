## Sample Code
Download the [sample code](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/views_and_controls/collection_views/implementing_modern_collection_views) to learn more about Modern Collection Views.

## Modern Collection View APIs Overview
![][modern_collection_view_apis]

## Diffable Data Source
### Recap

* Introduced in iOS 13.
* Simplifies UI State.
* Automatic animations.
* More to watch session [220](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/220) from WWDC 19: Advances in UI Data Sources.

### New in iOS 14
#### [Section Snapshots](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/nsdiffabledatasourcesectionsnapshot)
* Encapsulates the data for a single section in a UICollectionView.
* Allow data sources to be more composable into section-sized chunks of data.
* Can present the same data with different layout in different sections.
* Allow modeling of hierarchical data, which is needed to support rendering outline-style UIs.

#### Examples
![][section_snapshots]

* Top: Horizontally scrolling section.
* Middle: Outline style section.
* Bottom: List section.

For more refer to the [`Advances in diffable data sources`][wwdc2010045] session.

## Compositional Layout
### Recap
* Introduced in iOS 13.
* Allows us to build rich, complex layouts by composing smaller, easy-to-reason bits of layout together.
* Describes what we want the layout to look like instead of how the layout ought to work.
* Provides section-specific layouts.
* For more refero to the [`Advances in Collection View Layout`][wwdc19215] session.

### New in iOS 14
#### [Lists](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicollectionviewcompositionallayout)
* `UITableView`-like appearance.
* Rich with features like swipe actions and many common cell layouts.
* Built on top of Compositional Layout.
* New concrete UICollectionViewListCell.
* Header and footer support.
* Sidebar appearance.

#### Examples
Creating a `UICollectionViewLayout` where every section in the collection view is a list with an inset grouped appearance.

```swift
let configuration = UICollectionLayoutListConfiguration(appearance: .insetGrouped)
let layout = UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout.list(using: configuration)
```

## Modern Cells
### [Cell Registrations](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicollectionview/cellregistration)
* Brand new way to configure cells.
* Simple, re-usable way to set up a cell from a view model.
* Eliminates the extra step of registering a cell class or nib to associate it with a re-use identifier.
* Uses a generic registration type, which incorporates a configuration closure for setting up a new cell from a view model.

```swift
let reg = UICollectionView.CellRegistration<MyCell, ViewModel> { cell, indexPath, model in
   // configure cell content 
}

let dataSource = UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource<S,I>(collectionView: collectionView) {
   collectionView, indexPath, item -> UICollectionViewCell in
   return collectionView.dequeueConfiguredReusableCell(using: reg, for: indexPath, item: item)
}
```

### [Cell Content Configurations](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uilistcontentconfiguration)
* Similar to `UITableViewCell`.
* To be used as any cell or even a generic UI view.
* Flexible.
* Lightweight.

```swift
var contentConfiguration = UIListContentConfiguration.cell()
contentConfiguration.image = UIImage(systemNamed:"hammer")
contentConfiguration.text = "Ready. Set. Code"
cell.contentConfiguration = contentConfiguration
```

### [Background Configurations](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uibackgroundconfiguration)
* Similar to content configurations, but applied to any cell's background with the ability to adjust properties such as color, border styles, and more.

```swift
cell.backgroundConfiguration = UIBackgroundConfiguration.clear()
```
