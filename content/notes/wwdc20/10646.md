## Web Inspector changes

- the toolbar and dashboard are now merged into a tab bar (to save on vertical space)
- tightened the spacing around many controls (allowing you to see more content)
- Dark Mode variants for all of the icons throughout Web Inspector
- possibility to toggle Dark Mode independently from the rest of the system in the Settings Tab

## New tabs Sources

![][sourcesImage]

Overview:

- lists all resources loaded by the inspected page since Web Inspector was opened, including long-lived things like 'WebSocket's or more ephemeral things like XHRs or 'fetch's.
- primary place for JavaScript debugging, containing all of the JavaScript debugger stepping controls and many of the breakpoint adding capabilities
- used for network overriding capabilities
- When ispecting a response or part of a request, beside raw, we can also display the content as a `DOM Tree` (in case of web sources) or `Object Tree` (in case of JSON responses)

### Local overrides

![][localOverridesImage]

- allow you to modify resources loaded over the network
- Clicking the local override button (highlighted above) automatically copies the current contents of the displayed resource into a new local override for that resource.
- Once we change the resource, refresh the page and the override will take place
- by right-clicking on a local override in Web Inspector, we can select the "Edit Local Override…" action where it's also possible to modify the HTTP status code or any HTTP headers as well
- non-text resources, like images, can also be overridden and fully configured
- preserved across sessions of both the inspected page and Web Inspector itself

### Inspector Bootstrap Script

- we can be add a Inspector Bootstrap Script from the add resource button in the bottom corner of the navigation sidebar in the Sources Tab
- it's a way to modify the JavaScript API surface itself. 
- The contents of the Inspector Bootstrap Script are guaranteed to run before anything else in the inspected page.
- preserved across sessions of both the inspected page and Web Inspector itself

### New Javascript Breakpoints

- Debugger Statements breakpoint: controls whether or not JavaScript execution is paused at 'debugger' statements. 
- All Microtasks breakpoint: pauses JavaScript execution whenever any microtask is about to be executed (such as from 'Promise' objects or the 'queueMicrotask()' global function)
- All Animation Frames breakpoint: same as above, but for 'requestAnimationFrame' callbacks. 
- All Timeouts breakpoint: same as above, but for 'setTimeout' callbacks
- All Intervals breakpoint: same as above, but for 'setInterval' callbacks
- All Events breakpoint: pauses before any callback is invoked for any event listener, even those unrelated to the DOM

### Script blackboxing 

- defers any JavaScript debugger pauses that would occur in a script to pause at the first expression to execute outside of that script.
- useful to avoid global breakpoints to stop within jquery for example 

### Step debugger action

![][stepImage]

- resumes and re-pauses Javascript execution before the next expression in the current call frame
- basically a shortcut for Step in and Step outs

## Timelane Tab

Overview:

- captures activity in the inspected page
- plots records based on category
- import/export recording

What's new:

- new `Media & Animations` timeline
  - captures events related to media elements
  - captures the lifecycle of CSS animations and CSS transitions

## Storage Tab

Overview:

- enumerates data stored in the browser (cookies, LocalStorage, IndexDB, ..)

What's new:

- Provides filtering to find specific data
- Enhancements on editing and deleting data

## New Graphics Tab

- replaces the canvas tab
- shows preview for all `<canvas>` contexts and shaders
- supports recording Javascript API calls of `<canvas>` contexts
- (new) lists all web/css animations, CSS transitions

## New Layers Tab

![][layersImage]

- shows a live view of the layer tree of the inspected page
- lists the memory cost and the paint count for each layer

## Console tab

Overview:

- Lists all logs from the inspected page
- Allows arbitrary JavaScript evaluation
- Exposes special engine functionality

What's new:

- many new console functions:
  - `queryInstances(className)` will return an array of all objects that inherit from `className` 
  - `queryHolders(instanceName)` will return an array of all objects in the entire JavaScript heap that have a strong reference to `instanceName`

## Enable Intelligent Tracking Prevention Debug Mode

- new Developer menu option
- if active,  all debug logging from Safari's Intelligent Tracking Prevention will appear in the Web Inspector Console, and in the macOS system Console.app
