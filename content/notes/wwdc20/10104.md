macOS has an all new design:

- a new toolbar with inline title, big bold controls and integration with the window’s split view
- full height sidebars with colorful icons and updated symbol iconography
- new appearance for lists/tables using a new inset selection style

Most of these changes happen automatically to your app (if you’re using classes like [`NSToolbar`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstoolbar) and [`NSSplitViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nssplitviewcontroller)).


## Sidebars

Sidebar: use [`NSSplitViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nssplitviewcontroller), items configured using [`NSSplitViewItem.Behavior.sidebar`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nssplitviewitem/behavior/sidebar)

- use full size content window mask - [`NSWindow.StyleMask.fullSizeContentView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindow/stylemask/1644646-fullsizecontentview), so that content is laid out in the space normally taken by the title bar

[`NSView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview) properties to find the safe areas of the view:

- [`safeAreaInsets`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview/3553227-safeareainsets), [`safeAreaLayoutGuide`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview/3553228-safearealayoutguide), [`safeAreaRect`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview/3553229-safearearect)
- also available on the storyboard (“Safe Area Layout Guide”)

New view item in the library: "Window Controller with Sidebar" ([`NSWindowController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindowcontroller) + [`NSSplitViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nssplitviewcontroller))

Opting out of the full height sidebar: [`NSSplitViewItem.allowsFullHeightLayout`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nssplitviewitem/3608197-allowsfullheightlayout)

- use this when sidebar is typically collapsed, or when you need more space for the toolbar

Accent colors:

- by default all sidebar icons are colored with user's chosen accent color
- use [`NSOutlineViewDelegate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsoutlineviewdelegate) method [`outlineView(_: tintConfigurationForItem:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsoutlineviewdelegate/3626816-outlineview) to customize, return an instance of [`NSTintConfiguration`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstintconfiguration):
  - [`.default`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstintconfiguration/3626820-default) - always uses the system accent color
  - [`.monochrome`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstintconfiguration/3626822-monochrome) - gray monochrome
  - [`init(preferredColor:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstintconfiguration/3626824-init) - use this color when default (“rainbow”) accent color is used, but follow the accent color if it’s customized
  - [`init(fixedColor:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstintconfiguration/3626823-init) - a fixed color that is always used (e.g. the yellow star in Mail’s VIP folder)
- use sidebar colors to distinguish different sections of the sidebar, or highlight a specific item like the VIP star
- or use monochrome to de-emphasize groups


## Toolbars

There’s no longer any special material behind the toolbar items, it’s a uniform part of the content of the window (this works automatically).

New toolbar styles, controlled through [`NSWindow.toolbarStyle`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindow/3608199-toolbarstyle) - [`NSWindowToolbarStyle`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindow/toolbarstyle):

[`.unified`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindow/toolbarstyle/unified)

- the new standard - like in the new versions of system apps
- larger controls, bold icons
- inline title located at the leading edge of the title bar next to the sidebar
- good choice for most windows

[`.unifiedCompact`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindow/toolbarstyle/unifiedcompact)

- more compressed style
- regular sized controls, smaller toolbar height
- this is what was previously used if the window was configured to hide the title bar
- now supports an optional inline title
- use when user’s focus should be on the content of the window and there aren’t many elements in the toolbar

[`.preference`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindow/toolbarstyle/preference)

- specifically designed for preference windows
- automatic when you’re using [`NSTabViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstabviewcontroller) with the [`.toolbar`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstabviewcontroller/tabstyle/toolbar) tab style

[`.expanded`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindow/toolbarstyle/expanded)

- what used to be the standard layout of the toolbar
- title is centered on top of the toolbar and can expand across the window
- large button icons with labels below
- use when the window title is long, or the toolbar is heavily populated with items, or when you want to keep existing toolbar layout

[`.automatic`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindow/toolbarstyle/automatic)

- default value
- determines the toolbar style based on your window structure
- existing apps linked on older SDKs keep their old layout

Toolbar buttons no longer have a border, a shape only appears when hovering

- controls with text fields show a slight border so that you know where you can click to focus

[`NSToolbarItem`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstoolbaritem) [`minSize`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstoolbaritem/1531777-minsize) & [`maxSize`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstoolbaritem/1526451-maxsize) properties are deprecated - macOS can automatically give your controls a proper size; you can still use constraints if necessary.

New [`NSWindow.subtitle`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindow/3608198-subtitle) property:

- shows a smaller subtitle under the window title, e.g. the message count in Mail
- in [`.expanded`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindow/toolbarstyle/expanded) style it appears next to the title

Controls like back/forward buttons should be put on the leading edge of the title bar, before the title

- set [`NSToolbarItem.isNavigational`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstoolbaritem/3622481-isnavigational) to position them there
- users can add and remove them from the toolbar, but can only put them in the leading edge area

[`NSSearchToolbarItem`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nssearchtoolbaritem):

- new toolbar control for search text fields
- appears as a text field if there’s enough space, otherwise collapsed into an icon
- use [`searchField`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nssearchtoolbaritem/3634330-searchfield) property to access the text field itself
- works on older versions of macOS

[`NSTrackingSeparatorToolbarItem`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstrackingseparatortoolbaritem):

- a separator that extends the separator line of the window content’s split view upwards through the toolbar
- when creating, you pass it the split view to track and the index of its divider

To position items in the title bar area of the sidebar, include an [`NSToolbarItem.Identifier.sidebarTrackingSeparator`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstoolbaritem/identifier/3622482-sidebartrackingseparator) item and add those items *before* the sidebar separator item.

The toolbar has no border below, but a slight shadow appears below it to separate it from the content when the content is scrolled

- this happens if the scroll view fills the frame and you’re using [`.fullSizeContentView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindow/stylemask/1644646-fullsizecontentview)
- otherwise, there will be a separator regardless of the scrolling position
- customize toolbar separator in the window using [`NSWindow.titlebarSeparatorStyle`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindow/3622489-titlebarseparatorstyle), or in split view per section using [`NSSplitViewItem.titlebarSeparatorStyle`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nssplitviewitem/3622473-titlebarseparatorstyle)


## Controls

New modern design of controls like popup buttons, sliders, segmented controls

New multicolor system accent color - uses each app’s preferred accent color

- define the app’s global accent color in the asset catalog (can be different for light/dark mode) + set the name in build options
- people can still chose one of the previously available accent colors, and then that color overrides your setting so they can use that color everywhere
- it’s preferred to use named colors like [`controlAccentColor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nscolor/3000782-controlaccentcolor), [`selectedContentBackgroundColor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nscolor/2998830-selectedcontentbackgroundcolor), [`keyboardFocusIndicatorColor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nscolor/1532031-keyboardfocusindicatorcolor) instead of explicitly using your own color for controls

New [`.large`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nscontrol/controlsize/large) control size

- e.g. when you need one large action button
- works for: a few kinds of buttons, text fields, search fields, segmented controls
- also used in the unified toolbar style, and in system alerts

New inset style for table selection - adds extra padding, taller default row heights

[`NSTableView.style`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstableview/style):

- [`.automatic`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstableview/style/automatic) (default)
- [`.fullWidth`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstableview/style/fullwidth) - edge to edge selection background, like previously
- [`.inset`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstableview/style/inset)
- [`.sourceList`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstableview/style/sourcelist) - new appearance of sidebar source list
- automatic style uses `.inset` by default (on apps built on the latest SDK), `.fullWidth` in bordered scroll views, `.sourceList` in source lists
  - you can check the [`effectiveStyle`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstableview/3622474-effectivestyle) property to see what style is actually used
- the old [`SelectionHighlightStyle.sourceList`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstableview/selectionhighlightstyle/sourcelist) setting is deprecated


## Text

System text styles are now available (Large Title, Headline, Body etc.) - but without Dynamic Type, so they have one constant size.

```swift
NSFont.preferredFont(forTextStyle: options:)
NSFontDescriptor.preferredFontDescriptor(forTextStyle: options:)
```

## Symbol images

SF Symbols is now available on the Mac:

```swift
NSImage.init?(systemSymbolName: accessibilityDescription:)
```

- they can scale to different font sizes and weights
- toolbar and sidebar items automatically configure symbol images to match the size & style of the container
- it’s best to use them inside [`NSImageView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsimageview) (see [`symbolConfiguration`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsimageview/3667456-symbolconfiguration) property)
- to customize symbol configuration, use [`NSImage.withSymbolConfiguration(…)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsimage/3656508-withsymbolconfiguration)
- most of existing named system images now return some kind of symbol image from SF Symbols
