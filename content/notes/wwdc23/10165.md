## Editing
- All simulators are now optional to download, reducing Xcodes download size further
- Code completion is faster, makes less mistakes
- Press ➡️ key to get all overloads of a function in auto-complete
- Function suggestions are now ordered by usage frequency and context-aware
- Symbols are now generated for Images and Colors in Asset Catalogs
- use via `Image(.yourImage)` or `ImageResource.yourImage` with autocompletion support & compiler checks
- likewise you can use `Color(.yourColor)` or `ColorResource.yourColor` with autocompletion
- String Catalogs replace `.strings` and `.stringsdict` files – migrate those legacy files via right-click "Migrate"
- A visual editor shows all languages with their current translation progress and all singular & pluraized translations in one place
- New translation keys in code are automatically detected and added to the file
- Real-time preview of documentation by using Assistant Editor
- Macros make for more expressive APIs, help eliminate repeated code
- `@Observable`, `#Predicate`, `@Model` examples of macros from Apple
- New template for creating your own macro packages with sample code provided
- "Expand Macro" in quick actions menu (Cmd + Shift + A) shows code that's generated by macro – supports breakpoints
- `#Preview { ... }` replaces `PreviewProvider` protocol, much easier & more flexible
- `#Preview` even supports UIKit & AppKit directly, just create a `ViewController` for example
- `#Preview` supports also Widget timeline, previewing all differentt time views

## Navigating
- New Bookmarks navigator (in left menu), right-click any code or search query to add a bookmark
- You can provide a description for the bookmark, which shows from right side of the code (like `#warning`)
- Bookmarks are groupable (like folders), to give them different semantic meanings like TODOs/reminders/etc.
- You can "complete" a bookmark by pressing a checkbox to its left, or simply delete them – same result
- New type of search queries available: "conforming type" e.g. to find all conformances to `ViewModifier` protocol
- When a search query is bookmarked, you need to press "refresh" button to re-execute query & update matches

## Sharing
- Uncommitted changes now presented in a single scrollable view
- You can make smaller changes to your code right within that view if you find small issues like typos
- Stage changes

## Testing
- 45% fater reporting
- You can filter tests at the bottom left
- New design for reports with a high-level summary of test plan: Top Insights, Stats with pie chart, & more
- New "Performance Metrics" tab
- UI tests have full recording until fail, plays automatically when stepping through test, timeline for scrubbing available
- Even the UI hierarchy is recorded so you can see the hierarchy at any given time during the test

## Debugging
- OSLog deeply integrated to Xcode
- Initialize: `let logger = Logger(subsystem:...)`
- Then call: `logger.info(...)`, `logger.warning(...)`, `logger.error(...)`, `logger.notice(...)`
- Clean presentation of logs in Console with background color & optional metadata fields
- Filtering possible based on metadata, like log level
- Right-clicking and selecting "Jump to Source" brings you to line where log happened

## Distributing
- Xcode Cloud: Test notes support, Notarization support
- Signature Verification for `.xcframework`s
- New Privacy Manifest file for 3rd party frameworks
- Xcode produces PDF report based on all privacy manifests or included frameworks to help fill App Stor Connect privacy labels
- New TestFlight internal testing option during distribution to prevent accidental release to customers
- New push notification when uploaded build processing finished on Connect (build ready for distribution)
