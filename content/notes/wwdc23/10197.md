## Prerequisites

- [What's new in SF Symbols 4](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10157) from WWDC2022 explains variable color in SF Symbols, automatic choice of rendering mode and more. 
- Kodeco also offers a fairly recent tutorial, [SF Symbols 3 for iOS: What’s New](https://www.kodeco.com/28867639-sf-symbols-3-for-ios-what-s-new), to get you started working with SF Symbols including the SF Symbols app while building a London Transport-themed sample app.

## What's New? Animation!

A quick look back:

2021: three new rendering modes beyond monochrome:
- Hierarchical
- Palettes
- Multicolor 

2022: variable color, used to communicate
- Different strength levels, or
- A sequence over time

By default, symbols animate by **layer**. You can optionally animate a whole symbol.

Symbols animate conceptually through front, back and middle planes, with the ability to move up (appear bigger), down (appear smaller, like a more distant object) or even disappear entirely.

### Configurable Animation Presets

- **Appear**: use when a symbol appears in the interface.
- **Disappear**: use when a symbol is removed from the interface.
- **Bounce**: confirm a successful interaction or completed action, reinforce a concept, add playfulness.
- **Scale**: confirm an action or highlight importance, provide focus or feedback. Scale is stateful, meaning its effect persists until it is removed.
- **Pulse**: convey ongoing activity by changing opacity. Works well with a single layer in a symbol.
- **Variable Color**: _cumulative_ highlights the layers one after another while retaining its previous state. Example: the wi-fi symbol showing an active connection. _iterative_ highlights the layers in a sequence one at a time. Example: the wi-fi symbol searching for a network.**
- **Replace**: swap one symbol for another to indicate a change in functionality. You can configure directionality, choosing whether symbols move up or down as one replaces the other.

## Animating Your Own Symbols

- Symbols are vector drawings. 
- Draw paths as completely enclosed paths.
- Use **erase layers** for better animation.

Bring your custom symbol into the SF Symbols app to set Draw and Erase layers. This is also where you can set layer colors for multicolor animations.

## New Symbols

Additions in the following areas were highlighted:
- Automotive, including EV plugs
- Gaming (controllers)
- Weather (including rainbow)

## Further Resources

See Apple's developer site for a [more professional summary](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/) of SF Symbols 5.

There are two related sessions coming in WWDC2023:

- [Create animated symbols](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc23/10257)
- [Animate symbols in your app](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc23/10258)

You'll want to download the latest (beta at the time of this writing) [SF Symbols app](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/).

You may also want to check out one of the many third-party SF Symbol tools. One fun new one currently in TestFlight beta is [Symbolsaurus](https://testflight.apple.com/join/37LGuo07), which lists which apps on your device use a particular symbol so you can see it in context.
