## Prerequisites

- [What's new in SF Symbols 4](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10157) from WWDC2022 explains variable color in SF Symbols, automatic choice of rendering mode and more. 
- Kodeco also offers a fairly recent tutorial, [SF Symbols 3 for iOS: What’s New](https://www.kodeco.com/28867639-sf-symbols-3-for-ios-what-s-new), to get you started working with SF Symbols including the SF Symbols app while building a London Transport-themed sample app.

## What's New? Animation!

A quick look back:

2021: three new rendering modes beyond monochrome:
- Hierarchical
- Palettes
- Multicolor 

2022: variable color, used to communicate
- Different strength levels, or
- A sequence over time

By default, symbols animate by **layer**. You can optionally animate a whole symbol.

Symbols animate conceptually through front, back and middle planes, with the ability to move up (appear bigger), down (appear smaller, like a more distant object) or even disappear entirely.

### Configurable Animation Presets

- **Appear**: use when a symbol appears in the interface.
- **Disappear**: use when a symbol is removed from the interface.
- **Bounce**: confirm a successful interaction or completed action, reinforce a concept, add playfulness.
- **Scale**: confirm an action or highlight importance, provide focus or feedback. Scale is stateful, meaning its effect persists until it is removed.
- **Pulse**: convey ongoing activity by changing opacity. Works well with a single layer in a symbol.
- **Variable Color**: Conveys varying levels of strength and relies on color to communicate a state of a symbol changing over time.
  - **Cumulative**: Highlights the layers one after the other while keeping its previous state - a great way of representing the Wi-Fi symbol enabling a wireless connection.
  - **Iterative**: Highlights the layers in a sequence, but one at a time, which is an effective way of representing the Wi-Fi symbol searching for available networks.
  - **Reversing**: Makes the highlighted layers reverse to its original point, immediately starting the sequence once again, until the action is interrupted.
- **Replace**: One symbol is swapped with another. Used to communicate changes in the state of a symbol, indicating a shift in functionality.
  - **Down/Up**: The initial symbol is scaled down, replaced with the new symbol, and then scaled up.
  - **Up/Up**: The initial symbol is scaled up, it disappears, and the new symbol appears scaling up.

> All these new presets can serve as a communication tool between a person and the interface and have a crucial role in enhancing the user experience, but it's important to work on achieving the right balance between attention-grabbing animations and a functional interface, so that the experience doesn't result in something overwhelming. So always aim to prioritize functionality and keep your intended goal in mind.

## Animating Your Own Symbols

- Symbols are vector drawings. 
- Draw paths as completely enclosed paths.
- Use **erase layers** for better animation.

![Describe a custom symbol's layers in the SF Symbols app][layers]

[layers]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10197/CustomSymbolLayersInApp.png

Bring your custom symbol into the SF Symbols app to set Draw and Erase layers. This is also where you can set layer colors for multicolor animations.

*See more in the session "Create animated symbols".*

## New Symbols

**NEW:** Over 700 new symbols (now over 5000 unique symbols available).

**NEW:** Expanding of the Automotive category with symbols like steering wheels, car seats, and seated figures.

**NEW:** Expanding of the Gaming category, with arcade consoles, arcade sticks, and different types of buttons. 

**NEW:** New symbols representing the different types of EV plugs.

**NEW:** New weather symbols like moonrise, moonset and rainbow.

**NEW:** A new an improved SF Symbols app is available at [https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols).

## Further Resources

See Apple's developer site for a [more professional summary](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/) of SF Symbols 5.

There are two related sessions coming in WWDC2023:

- [Create animated symbols](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc23/10257)
- [Animate symbols in your app](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc23/10258)

You'll want to download the latest (beta at the time of this writing) [SF Symbols app](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/).

You may also want to check out one of the many third-party SF Symbol tools. One fun new one currently in TestFlight beta is [Symbolsaurus](https://testflight.apple.com/join/37LGuo07), which lists which apps on your device use a particular symbol so you can see it in context.
