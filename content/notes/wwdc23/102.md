- What is a good platform?
- One where the most natural way to write code is also the best.

## Swift

- Swift Macros make APIs easier to use without boilerplate code
- "expand macro" button in Xcode shows the generated code during the compilation process (to understand better)
- `@AddAsync` macro makes any completion-handler function available as an async-await API, too

## SwiftUI
- Recent releases Logic Pro & Final Cut Pro make use of SwiftUI
- Pie Charts coming to Swift Charts
- More complete MapKit support
- Animations improved: New default style is `.spring` –> more bouncy apps
- Animated SF Symbols
- `.animationPhase` and keyframing for more detailed animations

## Data Flow
- `@State` and `@Environment` enough, no `@StateObject` or `@EnvironmentObject` needed anymore
- `@Observable` macro replaces `@Published` and `ObservableObject`
- Automatic detection of fields are refrenced in SwiftUI

## Persistence
- New Swift-native layer on top of Core Data
- Uses `@Model` macro to turn a `class` into a Model object
- Automatic support for persistence, iCloud, Redo/Undo
- `@Attribute(.unique)` like APIs for marking fields
- `@Query(sort: .name)` like APIs for querying in views

## WidgetKit
- used in many places now (many OSes)
- simple actions possible using `Button`
- we need to identify the background with `.containerBackground` modifier & update padding to support new places
- easy "magic move" like animations
- `@Preview` macro shows Timeline in SwiftUI previews


## TipKit
- customizable templates for educate users on first usage
- syncs "already shown" state across devices

## Misc
- `ShareLink` can be used for new AirDrop support
- Game porting toolkit: 1. Evaluate with emulation, 2. Convert & compile shaders, 3. Convert graphics code
- AVCapture gets performance improvements
- ISO HDR API to display images
- Video Conferencing: Gesture-based animation effect triggers can be observed
- New ScreenCaptureKit picker
- external cameras can be added to IPad apps
- tvOS apps can use camera, e.g. games with gestures, or gesture-remote – via `.continuityDevicePicker(...)`

## watchOS
- New `.tabViewStyle(.verticalPage)` for vertical pages
- custom Workout API for workout plans

## Accessibility
- 1.3 billion people worldwide with disabilities
- Pauses Aimating Images (like GIFs)
- Dims Flashing Lights (when AVFoundation used)
- visionOD comes with many accessibility tools out of the box

## Privacy
- New "add-only" calendar permissions
- "Private picker" mode in Photos for 3rd party apps
- New "Privacy Manifests" for 3rd-party SDKs so Xcode can automatically fill form in App Store Connect
- Communication Safety: sensitive content analysis framework, e.g. for nudity detection

## StoreKit
- Collection of views: `ProductView`, `SubscriptionStoreView`
- Automatically displays applicable offers
- SKAdNetwork now supports re-engangement

## Xcode
- Source Editor with better auto-completion
- Type-safe color and image assets through `ImageResource` and `ColorResource` (& more APIs)
- Git staging & unpushed commits built-in
- Redesigned test reports with heatmap
- UI tests now record video of interaction before fail
- Xcode Cloud: Distribute to TestFligth, Notariation, Redesigned Linter (up to 5x faster), Mergeable libraries

## visionOS
- development with SwiftUI, RealityKit, and ARKit
- Shared Space: Default, like Desktop
- SwiftUI scenes: Window, Volume, Full Space (entire environment)
- 2D apps with 3D extends via `.offset(z: ...)`
- ornaments for toolbars/menus (on the left)
- RealityKit: Dynamic foveation (shaper where eyes look)
- ARKit: understands space adround use, finger/wrist or head for visionOD selection
- Simulator on macOS available – only VR mode, no AR mode (through iPhone Camera Continuity)
- Reality Composer Pro: Preview 3D content, integrates with Xcode build process
- TestFlight available on visionOS
- Unity: all advantages of visionOS
- User Input: hover effects via look (not communicated for privacy reasons), finger tap for click
- Early Preview: "Spacial Personas" – for Vison Pro to Vision Pro FaceTime calls
- Detailed Documentation & Tools available
- VisionPro Developer Labs in 6 locations for testing: Lodon, Munich, Shanghai, Singapore, Tokyo, and Cupertino

WWDC23: 175 sessions, 40 for visionOS alone
