- TipKit is a new framework that makes it easy to shop tips in your app (for feature discoverability)
- Designed with education in mind to teach about brand new / hidden feature or faster way to accomplish a task
- Available on iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV (not in Vision Pro ?)

## Create a tip

- Conform custom type to `Tip` which has `title: Text` and `message: Text` requirements, `Text` view can be customized
- Recommended usage when tips are: actionable, instructional, and easy to remember

- Not recommended for: Promotional messages, Error messages, pure information that is not actionable, too complex text

- Call `TipsCenter.shared.configure` on app start (e.g. `init()` of `App`)
- `Tip` protocol optionally has an `asset: Image` to show an icon alongside tip
- `Tip` protocol also optionally has `actions: [Action]` where you can return `Tip.Action(id:title:)` instances for buttons (like "Learn More" or "Open Settings")
- 2 types of tip views:
	- `.popoverMiniTip(tip: ...)`: Appears over app's UI, no need to change app screen – on tvOS this is the only option
	- Inline views: Adjusts the app's UI to temporarily fit around it

## Eligibility rules

- 2 types of rules to decide when to show a tip:
	- Parameter-based rules: State and Bool comparisons, persistent, best suited for Swift value types
	- Event-based rules: User actions that must be performed before showing tip
- For parameter-based rule, use `@Parameter` on a static stored propertty like `static var isLoggedIn: Bool = false` of your custom `Tip` conforming type, and:
- Specify `#Rule(Self.$isLoggedIn) { $0 == true }` in a `rules: Predicate<RuleInput...>` computed property within your type
- For event-based rule, specify a static stored property like `static let appStarts: Event = Event<AppStartDonation>(id: "app-start")`, and:
- Specify `#Rule(Self.appStarts) { $0.count >= 3 }` in a `rules: Predicate<RuleInput...>` computed property within your type
- Don't forget to "donate" the event when it happens, like calling `.onAppear { CustomTip.appStarts.donate() }`

Example with both parameter-based and event-based rules combined:

- You can not only use `.count` on `Event` but also `.donations` which have a `date` property for more complex logic, like "3 times within last week"
- You can even specify your custom `DonationValue` types with additional details like `ID`s of your models or more

## Display and dismissal

- Display frequency of tips can be set so they appear at an ideal cadence, we don't want to show them all at once
- To show one tip per day, on app start use: `TipsCenter.shared.configure { DisplayFrequency(.daily) }` (or `.hourly`, custom `TimeInterval`, or `.immediate`)
- A specific `Tip` conformance can override frequency via computed property `options: [Option] { [.ignoresDisplayFrequency(true)] }`
- Call `customTip.invalidate(reason: .userPerformedAction)` to dismiss a tip that is presented or to never show a tip for an action the user has already performed
- Additionally, you can provide a max display count via `options: [Option] { [.maxDisplayCount(5)] }` computed property on a `Tip` type
- TipKit can sync tip status via iCloud to sync multi-device on same app (didn't explain how or if customizable)


## Test tips

- To inspect all tips without needing to satisfy the eligibility rules, perform `TipsCenter.showAllTips()` for testing
- You can also show certain tips via `TipsCenter.showTips([tip1, tip2, tip3])` by passing their IDs, or hide them via `.hideTips(...)`
- To hide all tips to focus on a new feature for example, call `TipsCenter.hideAllTips()`
- Use `TipsCenter.resetDatastore()` to reset persisted eligibility data to get same experience on each run during development
- All the above options can also be passed via launch arguments in Scheme Editor in Xcode:
