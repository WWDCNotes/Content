## Introduction

- Over time catalog supersedes `.strings` and `.stringsdict` files
- Strings automatically extraced by Xcode
- New keys added to all locales
- Supports parameters through String interpolation
- You can provide device-specific Strings by right-clicking (e.g. a longer text or differente term on Mac)

## Extract

- A localizable String has 4 components: key (required), default value (optional, default: key), comment (optional), table (optional, default: "Localizable")
- New single `.xcstrings` file replaces all different `en.lproj/Localizable.strings` files with no need for `.lproj` folders
- Xcode searches for localization Strings in: SwiftUI views, Storyboards, .xib files, ObjC code, C code, Shortcut phrases, `Info.plist` files
- Use `Text(..., comment: ..., bundle: ...)`
- For localizable views provided in frameworks, use `LocalizedStringResource` type -> recommended for representing and passing around
- `LocalizedStringResource` supports comment, table, default value
- You can use `String(localized:)` or `AttributedString(localized:)` (to create `LocalizedStringResource`?)
- "Use compiler to extract Swift Strings" build setting enabled by default
- Extraction woks from: `NSLocalizedString`, or any custom names provided to "LocalizedString Macro Names" build setting
- Strings in Interface Builder are localizable, too (but no way to ignore a specific one, I filed a feedback: FB12264777)
- Use `InfoPlist.xcstrings` for Info.plist -> automatic extraction
- Xcode includes big improvements for how Shortcut phrases are localized (dedicated session)
- If code provides `defaultValue:` updates, the Strings catalog updates –> code is "source of truth"
- Removed code that has no translations get removed automatically, if translation exists then marked as "Stale"

## Edit

- There's a way to mark a key as "Manually" managed to silence the "stale" warning
- Another red warning for "Untranslated" keys
- There's also a way to mark keys for "Needs Review" or "Reviewed"
- Pluralization is built into & simplified with substitutes like `@birds` and `@yards` when multiple params exist
- Keys you add manually (not through extraction) are marked as "Manually" managed by default
- Right-click on key and choose "Vary by plural" to turn singular String to a pluralized String

## Export

- Exporting works like before, creates an `xcloc` file which contains all localizables, includig images (standardized format)
- String Catalogs work for older OS versions as well -> they get converted to `.strings` and `.stringsdict` file on build
