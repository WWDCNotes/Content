## Key design principles
* Main Question: what is the most relevant information of my app?
* Example new weather app
* Watch experience should be optimised on brief interaction
* Digital crown interactions should be always backed up by touch interaction
* Which information would be the core for a widget of my app
    * Build app around this foundation

## Navigation
* NavigationSplitView
    * Concept borrowed by two column layout
    * Perfect if app has source list
    * App should open directly in detail
    * Transition between source list and detail view
    * API similar to other plattforms
* TabView
    * Example: Activity app
    * Animations based on election view
        * matchedGeometryEffect for merging and animating content between tabs
* NavigationStack
    * Lead people into and back from hierarchical structure


## Layout
* Flexibel Grid
* 3 foundational layouts
    * List
        * Scroll though content
    * Dail
        * Dense information delivered at one glance
    * Infograhic
        * Ideal for data visualisation
* Topbar Leading and Topbar Trailing Placement
    * Time moves to center
* More control on screen by using less interaction time

## Color and materials
* Should give sense of view hierarchy
* Four background materials
    * Ultra Thin, Thin, regular, thick
* Use color to differentiate similar views
* Convey state change with color
* Vibrant versions of all system colors
* Example: Noise App
* NavigationBar with blur
