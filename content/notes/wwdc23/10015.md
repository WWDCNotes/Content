## About pre-orders

- When you make your app available for pre-order, its product page becomes published on the App Store. The app can be purchased before it's released for download.
- On release day, your customers will be notified and your app will be automatically downloaded on their devices.

## What's new

- Ability to offer your app for pre-order on a regional basis.
- You can also first release your app to a few regions, as a soft launch or limited release, and then offer your app for pre-order in any other region you choose.

- Pre-order apps are discoverable through search, and may be featured on the Today, Games, or Apps tabs on the App Store.
- The performance of your pre-orders can be tracked from within App Analytics, where you can find the number of purchased pre-orders by date and by region.
- You'll be able to run custom product pages and product page optimization tests for any pre-order app.
