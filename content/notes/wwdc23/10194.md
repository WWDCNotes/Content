### Lock Screen Design Tips

![Live Activity: lock screen nargins][1-lock-screen-margins]

- Be aware of 14pt margins added to all notifications.
---
![Live Activity: show unique layout in lock screen][2-show-unique-layout]

- Try not to replicate the notification layouts themselves. Rather, create a layout that is unique and specific to the information you are displaying.
- Buttons should only be used if they're controlling an essential part of the activity itself
---
![Live Activity: match app style in lock screen][3-matching-app-style]

- Best result is when your Live Activity and app feel like they share the same visual aesthetic and personality
	- Consider the colors, iconography, typefaces, and other attributes from your app that you can use
	- Don't alter your colors between light and dark mode if it breaks this visual association
---
![Live Activity: change content colors in lock screen][4-change-colors]

- You can also change the colors based on the content that it's representing to create a more dynamic and engaging visual of your information.
---
![Live Activity: integrate logo in lock screen][5-integrate-logo]

- If you do use a logo mark as part of your brand, make sure it's integrated uncontained into the layout itself rather than just using your whole app icon
---
![Live Activity: dismiss button in lock screen][6-automatic-dismiss-button]

- The background and foreground colors your Live Activity provides are used to automatically generate a matching dismiss button when swiping
	- Make sure to check that the resulting button looks correct
---
### Spacing

IMPORTANT: Ensure your Live Activities are not too tall, since this area is shared with notifications, music player, etc

![Live Activity: grow and shrink in lock screen][7-grow-and-shrink]

- Look for ways to reduce the height of your design by adjusting the size and placement of elements so they can better fit together and be more compact.
- Dynamically change the height of your Live Activity between different moments as you have more or less information to display.
---
### Transitions

- Use the numeric content transition to count up or down important numbers in your Activity.
- For animating in and out graphic elements and text, use the content replace transition.
- You can also create your own by combining different animations of the scale, opacity, and position of elements.

### Alerting

- Do not send secondary notifications to alert user of something related to your Live Activity, instead use your Live Activity
	- Alerting lights up the screen and plays the standard notification sound
	- Emphasize the information that caused the alert in your layout during this transition.

### Removal

- If your Live Activity has ended and is no longer relevant, make sure to remove it from the lock screen after a short duration of time
---
## Standby Design Tips

![Live Activity: standby view][8-standby]

- Standby is a new feature that lets you use your iPhone as an ambient informational display. 
- Your layout is scaled up 200% to maximize its size
	- Ensure assets and images you are using in your design are high enough resolution to be displayed at this larger size
---
![Live Activity: avoid edge styling][9-avoid-edge-styling]

- Avoid using graphic elements that extend to the edge of your Live Activity, use dividing lines or a containing shape instead
---
![Live Activity: remove background in standby mode][10-remove-background]

- When in Standby mode, consider removing your background and blend your layout seamlessly into the device bezel
---
![Live Activity: night mode in standby][11-night-mode]

- Live Activities in SandBy automatically gain "night mode" that transitions the display to a red tint in low light.
	- Check to make sure your colors have enough contrast while in night mode
---
## Dynamic Island Design Tips

![Live Activity: dynamic island][12-dynamic-island]

- Use of animation and continuously updating data here makes it feel more alive
- Extra rounded, thicker shapes, as well as large, heavier weight, easy-to-read text works well
- Use color to convey identity
---
![Live Activity: dynamic island concentric shapes][13-concentric-shape]

- Dynamic Island is very sensitive to the shape and placement of things inside it. It’s really important to place objects and information in it in a way that stays in harmony with this shape.
	- Be concentric with its shape. This is when rounded shapes nest inside of each other with even margins all the way around.
---
### Different Size Classes

#### Compact View

![Live Activity: compact view in dynamic island][14-compact-view]

- Compact is most common. Used help people keep an eye on an Activity while using their phone.
- It’s meant to be informational, communicating the most essential things about an activity
	- When you want to show multiple sessions for your app going on at once, consider ticking between the display of them
---
![Live Activity: keep things snug in dynamic island for compact view][15-snug]

- Be as narrow as possible with no wasted space.
- Ensure content is snug against the sensor region.
---
![Live Activity: dynamic island alerts from compact view][16-alerts]

- If you need to alert users of an event during your session, rather than sending a push notification, when possible, expand the island to present that information
---
#### Expanded View

![Live Activity: expanded view in dynamic island][17-expanded-view]

- In addition to alerting you, people can press into the Dynamic Island to zoom into this view and see more information, and access essential controls.
- Try to get to the essence of your activity here, not showing too little or too much.
- Emphasize rounded, thicker shapes, and a liberal use of color to establish identity.
---
![Live Activity: keep cohesiveness in mind between expanded and compact][18-cohesive-style]

- Try and maintain the relative placement of things between the expanded/compact views for cohesiveness.
---
![Live Activity: wrap around sensor in expanded view][19-expanded-tallness]

- Try to keep the tallness of your expanded view within reason
- Avoid having a “forehead” at the top that calls attention to the sensor region
---
#### Minimal View

![Live Activity: minimal view in dynamic island][20-minimal-view]

- This view is shown when juggling between multiple sessions going on at once
---
![Live Activity: showing data in minimal view for dynamic island][21-minimal-show-data]

- Avoid reverting to purely just a logo here, and think about how your session can continue to convey information even in this tiny state.
