- "As with every Apple platform, the best way to build an app is with SwiftUI"

## SwiftUI in the Shared Space

- Most system applications on visionOS are written with SwiftUI
- First, add `visionOS` as a new platform in "Supported Destinations"
- Moving the cursor in the visionOS simulator replaces eye-tracking

- Glass is the standard background provided to windows by default
- No distinction between light and dark appearances (glass takes care of both)
- A lot of things work out of the box when your app is written in SwiftUI

## Polishing your app

- Apps can be positioned everywhere, so there's no specific number of pixels – visionOS scales content dynamically
- Prefer vectors over bitmaps to allow them to scale to any size
- Make sure to check "Preserve Vector Data" in Asset catalog for vector PDF files
- Solid colors have a fixed contrast against glass and can't adjust to surroundings, so avoid them, adopt vibrancy instead
- 4 semantic styles for `.foregroundStyle` modifier: `.primary`, `.secondary`, `.teriarty`, `.quaternay`
- For color fills, use semantic `Color.fill.tertiary` for example, instead of `Color.gray`
- 4 ways of interaction: Eyes, Hands, Pointer, Accessibility – most common is pinch gesture
- When close enough, you can simply directly touch a UI element in space
- Hover effects are crucial to make app feel responsive and give users confidence in interactions
- Standard controls have them automatically, but double-check custom views
- Add `.hoverEffect()` which by default brightens views and is rectangular
- Provide `contentShape(.hoverEffect, .rect(cornerRadius: 16))` to change the shape of the hover
- But consider simply wrapping custom views into a `Button` of `buttonStyle(.plain)`
- Hover effects were built for privacy – they are "the only way to make your app react to where people are looking"
- App is only told about "tap" or "hover" action, nothing else

## Brand new concepts

- iPad encourages sidebars, on visionOS consider a TabView (on the left) to switch between top-level views instead
- Toolbar ornaments should be commonly used, simple to add: `.toolbar { ToolBarItem(placement: .bottomOrnament) { ... } }`

- Toolbar ornaments provide a glass capsule background automatically
- Custom ornaments can be provided via `.ornament(attachmentAnchor: .scene(alignment: .bottom), contentAlignment: .center)`
- SwiftUI does not give custom ornaments a glass background by default, to opt-in, use: `.glassBackgroundEffect(in: .capsule)`
