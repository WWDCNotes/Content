## Grammatical agreement

- Use `^[Bienvenido](inflect: true) a tu iPhone` to provide automatic inflection (in supported languages like Spanish, French, or Italian)
- New locales added: European Portuguese and German

## Dependency agreement

- New API on localization options named `concepts` to pass a distinct string to another string which are related (e.g. ingredients of a food)

```Swift
var options = AttributedString.LocalizationOptions()
options.concepts = [.localizedPhrase(food.localizedName)]

let size = AttributedString(localized: "small", options: options)
```

- To choose the concept, provide a 1-indexed value like in `^pequeno](agreeWithConcept: 1)`
- The new `agreeWithConcept` option can be used even in older OS versions – it'll be ignored in them

- When multiple inflections in one text needed but only one gets `%@` argument passed, use new `agreeWithArgument: 1` instead on other

- To make demonstrative adjectives grammatically agree in French, use `^[Ce %@](inflect: true) conteient : %@.`

## Inclusive language

- New type `TermOfAddress` for `.masculine`, `.feminine`, or `.neutral` – can be passed as localization option in `.concepts` array

![][neutral]

- New `referenceConcept` attribute in agreement, like `"\(person.name) is on ^[their](referentConcept: 1) way."`
- You can provide custom `TermOfAddress` using `TermOfAddress.localized(language:pronouns:)` and pass array of `Mophology.Pronoun`
