# Migration to SwiftData
- How to migrate your app from Core Data to SwiftData
- SwiftData - Swift native persistence framework
- SwiftData - can co-exist with Core Data

# Common use cases
- Complete transition - replace Core Data with SwiftData
- Incremental transition - use Core Data and SwiftData side-by-side
- The first step is to generate SwiftData model classes
- Then decide; complete or incremental - depends on your use case

# Generate model classes
- SwiftData is a transition to using Swift code to generate your schema
- Can use Core Data managed object model to help generate SwiftData models
- In Xcode
— Select object model file
— Select Editor menu
— Click on Create SwiftData Code…
- This approach is not required if you are using SwiftData from scratch
- Once created, you will have a Swift file for each entity you migrated
- These will use the new `@Model` macro
- They will use `@Relationship` for properties that relate to properties on other models

# Complete adoption
- You will be **replacing** your Core Data stack with your SwiftData stack
- Swift native - allows for more legible code for persisting data
- Implicitly manages some features

## Considerations
- Core Data model designs **must** be supported in SwiftData
- Must have an exact match of entity name and properties in SwiftData

## Set up persistent stack
- Generate model classes
- Delete the Core Data managed object model file
- Also, can delete the persistence file previously used to help setup the Core Data stack
- Everything now managed through the new SwiftData model classes

## Set up ModelContainer
- This is the `ModelContainer` for the SwiftData stack
- `.modelContainer` is a modifier
- It ensures all models in a group can access the same persistent container
- You add it to a `View`

```
@main
struct TripsApp: App {
	var body: some Scene {
		WindowGroup {
		ContentView()
		}
		.modelContainer(
			for: [Trip.self, BucketListItem.self, LivingAccommodation.self])
	}
}
```
- This also sets a default `ModelContext` in the Environment
- `ModelContext` is used to track changes to instances of an app’s types
- Can be read from any `Scene` or `View` as follows:
```
@Enviroment(\.modelContext) private var modelContext
```

## Object creation
- **Before in Core Data…**

```
@Enviroment(\.managedObjectContext) private var viewContext

let newTrip = Trip(context: viewContext)
newTrip.name = name
newTrip.destination = destination
newTrip.startDate = startDate
newTrip.endDate = endDate
```

- **After in SwiftData…**

```
@Environment(\.modelContext) private var modelContext

let trip = Trip(name: name, destination: destination, startDate: startDate, endDate: endDate)

modelContext.insert(object: trip)
```

## Saving changes
- SwiftData has an implicit save
  - Triggered on UI lifecycle events
  - Or on timer after context is changed - if possible
- Can remove Core Data explicit saves and rely on SwiftData saving when context changes

## Fetching data
- Replace Core Data’s `@FetchRequest` with SwiftData’s `@Query`
- For example - fetch full list of Trip models

```
@Query(sort: \.startDate, order: .forward)

var trips: [Trip]
```

- Can also use predicates with `@Query` for finer control over the data returned

# Incremental adoption
- SwiftData will coexist with Core Data
- If a full conversion is not possible consider incremental adoption
- Two separate stacks talking to the **same persistent store**
- No need to rewrite existing Core Data code in order to start using new SwiftData code
- Ensure that both stacks are writing to the same URL
- Peristent History Tracking **must be turned on**
- SwiftData automatically turns this on but Core Data does not
- The store will be placed into read-only mode if Persistent History Tracking is not turned on
- Use incremental adoption when
  - Backwards compatibility required
  - Resource constraints may dictate only new work uses SwiftData

## Considerations
- Namespaces - names of SwiftData classes and Core Data classes must not collide!
- One name must change
  - Only the class name changes
  - The entity name it refers to will stay the same
- Keep schemas in sync in both SwiftData and Core Data
  - The schemas cannot diverge
  - Properties and relationships must be added in the exact same way in both schemas
  - This ensures entity hashes remain the same
  - If entity hashes differ it could trigger unwanted migrations and unintended consequences
- Schema versioning is important so SwiftData can evaluate the differences
- Can use SwiftData in UIKit and AppKit
  - Coexistence
    - bind UIKit code to Core Data
    - can work in parallel with SwiftData
  - Treat SwiftData classes as Swift classes and wrap your Swift code with UIKit code instead

# Takeaways

- Migration to SwiftData is flexible
- Complete migration - abandon Core Data, wish it well, but don’t turn back
- Incremental adoption - SwiftData and Core Data can co-exist, but watch out for jealousy over time
- Choose the best option for your use case
