> Creating experiences in three dimensions makes use of unique modalities such as depth and full field of view.

# Visual depth cues   
- Your content needs to give the viewer the right visual depth clues, as well-designed 3D content helps the brain to perceive depth   
- Vision comfort requires agreement between the depth intended by you and the depth perceived by the viewer   
- The brain relies on the eye muscles to converge the line of sight and fixate the eyes at the image depth to perceive a single image, so it needs correct visual depth cues to converge the eyes correctly

## How to use image cues to maintain vision comfort   
- Color perception helps us recognize familiar size cues   
- Blur gives a sense of depth   
- The relative size of an image can be used to provide depth information   
- Gentle motion can help to figure out how far away you need to look   
- Missing visual depth cues can be added with a background, light and shadow, occlusion, and texture density

### Conflicting cues are troublesome   
- Correct visual cues that can be confusing, like repeating patterns   
- You can avoid double vision by using smaller pieces of the pattern or breaking up the pattern with another design

> **Warning**
> If you decide to create stereo video content manually, it is extremely important to have the correct depth cues and also the correct disparity for each eye   

# Content parameters   
## Depth   
- Content that requires the eyes to be fixed for a long time, like reading, is most comfortable when it is placed farther than arms-length distance   
- Allow the content depth to be adjusted   
- Reserve content closest to the viewer for momentary visual effort experiences or for inviting direct interaction   

## Size and contrast   
- Content size and contrast should match the particular visual experience you are designing to allow for vision comfort For example:   
- Higher contrast for reading text   
- Lower contrast, transparency, or blur to redirect visual attention elsewhere   
- Choose the right font size, window size, and depth for long reading. Doing this will make it easy to read without having to move your head or body

- When a large portion of the field of view is dark, slow down the transition to a bright scene to give time to the eye for brightness adaptation   

# Eye effort   
- It's most comfortable for people to look downwards or left and right   
- Upward and diagonal eye rotation takes the most eye-muscle effort   

![Comfort versus effort in eye direction][Eye_Effort]

[Eye_Effort]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10078/Eye_Effort.png
 
- Content requiring extended reading or elongated target fixations should be placed towards the center and slightly below line of sight   
- Design for natural breaks in your experience to allow the person's eyes to rest   

# Motion of virtual objects   
You might feel motion discomfort like dizziness or an upset stomach when the visual motion information doesn't match the vestibular data   

> **Note**
> Well-designed content enables the brain to perceive the world as stationary

- When virtual objects, cover a large part of the field of view and move, the viewer's brain might interpret the visual motion of the objects as if the viewer themself is moving   
- Make the objects semitransparent when they move, so the passthrough content is clearly visible during the motion   

# Head-locked content
> **Warning**
> When possible, avoid content that is anchored to the user's head

If head-locked views are necessary:   
- Consider using a smaller window near the center of the view and farther away from the person   
- Use a lazy-follow animation   

# Motion in windows   
- When a window's content moves, the viewer's brain might think that the viewer themself is moving   
- Be mindful about camera motions   
- Keep the content horizon aligned with the real horizon   
- Move the camera in a way that the motion of the focus of expansion is slow and predictable   
- Keep the focus of expansion within the field of view   
- Avoid fast turns or pure rotational motion   
- Keep objects small and at a larger distance   

![The focus of expansion is the point where all the pixels appear to be coming from][Focus_Expansion]

- If possible, use plain textures with low luminance contrast   

# Oscillating motion   
- Avoid oscillations in general, and in particular those with frequencies around 0.2 Hz (1 oscillation every 5 seconds)   
- Keep the amplitude of the motion low and make the content semitransparent   

> **Note**
> It's always a good idea to provide an oscillation-free alternative through the Reduce Motion accessibility setting
