## Introduction

* When building an app for spatial computing: the best way to build it is with SwiftUI.

* New capabiltes such as Volumes and new 3D gestures, effects and layouts only exist in SwiftUI.

* The visionOS system has been built from the ground up with SwiftUI (e.g. buttons, toggles, Home View, Control Centre)

* SwiftUI elements adapt to the idioms of visionOS:
	* bordered buttons use a vibrant material background.
	* all buttons gain a rich hover effect that react to your eyes, hands and to pointer input.
	* buttons can automatically display a tooltip when you look at them.
	* TabView hangs by the side of your app.
	* TabView expands to display more detail just by looking at it.


## Scenes

![Kinds of Scenes on visionOS: Window, Volume, or Full Space][spatial-scenes]

[spatial-scenes]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10109/spatial-scenes.png

With spatial computing, there are 3 types of scenes that make up an app:
* **Windows**: great for building traditional and familiar interfaces (e.g. Safari, Freeform), and menus that lead into more immersive experiences (e.g. Mindfulness)

* **Volumes**: a new 3D window style: for displaying objects and experiences in a bounded space.

* **Full Spaces**: app gets complete control, hiding windows from other apps.

## Window

#### Ornaments

New concept added to SwiftUI: Ornaments.

Ornaments allow you to add accessory views relative to your app's window. They can even extend outside the window's bounds.

Create your own ornament using the `.ornament` modifier.

#### Materials

No dark or light appearance on visionOS. Materials do the hard work for you.

Secondary foreground style (`.foregroundStyle(.secondary)`) automatically uses a new vibrant treatment within its background material to increase visual weight.

### Interaction
- **Eyes**: Look at an element and use an indirect pinch gesture.
- **Hands**: reaching out and touching apps.
- **Pointer**: trackpad, hand gesture or hardware keyboard.
- **Accessibility**: e.g. VoiceOver, Switch Control.

New gestures added to SwiftUI, like `RotateGesture3D`.

#### Hover effects
* Critical to making your app responsive.
* Run outside of your app's process.
* Added automatically to most controls.
* If you're using a custom control style, make sure to add hover effects to make them responsive and easy to use.

## Volumes
* To add a volume, specify `.windowStyle(.volumetric)` on your `WindowGroup`.

### Model3D

![Use Model3D in SwiftUI like an AsyncImage][model3d]

[model3d]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10109/model3d.png

* To display a 3D model, use the new `Model3D` API from RealityKit.

* A `Model3D` always loads asynchornously. Similar to `AsyncImageView`, a `Model3D` can display a placeholder view.

* Layouts like `ZStack` are automatically aware of the depth of your content.

### RealityView

* `RealityView` provides easy access to the full power of RealityKit Pro.

* `SpatialTapGesture` gives the full 3D location of the tap.

* the `tagetedToAnyEntity` view modifier provides context like the entity you tapped on and the location relative to that entity.

* `RealityView` attachments allow mixing custom SwiftUI views together, inline with RealityKit entities.

## Full Spaces

### ImmersiveSpace

* Add an `ImmersiveSpace` scene.

* Provide an id to the space so you can programmatically open it from your main window.

* To open the space, use the new `openImmersiveSpace` environment action.

### Immersion styles

![Styles of Immersion on visionOS: Mixed, Progressive, or Full][immersion-styles]

[immersion-styles]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10109/immersion-styles.png

* Mixed, Progressive and Full immersion are supported.

* With Progressive immersion, you can use the digital dial to dial in how much immersion feels right to you.

* Use the `immersionStyle` view modifier.
