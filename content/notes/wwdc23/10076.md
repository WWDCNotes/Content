## UI Foundations

### App icons

![The 3 layers an App Icon consists of in visionOS][AppIcon]

[AppIcon]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10076/AppIcon.png

- App icons are familiar but 3D
- When looked at, they expand
- System handles this effect by adding specular highlights and shadows
- Use multiple layers
- Up to 3
- Each layer is a square image
- 1024×1024
- Circular mask is automatic
- Automatically shadow cast behind foreground layers
- Keep graphics centered
- Avoid layers with reduced opacity

### Materials
- Apps should be easy to place
- Apps should be easy to use at any distance 
- Apps should be easy to view in any lighting condition
- Windows act as a canvas for UI
- Avoid opaque windows
- Too many opaque windows makes UI feel heavy and overwhelming
- No distinct light and dark mode
- Lighting in the room influences the UI
- Glass window
- Sidebars use darker materials
- Other elements uses lighter materials
- Inputs that are highlighted might user darker materials
- Don’t stack lighter materials because it impacts contrast
- Unlike iOS/macOS: No light and dark modes, glass adapts naturally

### Typography

![System font weights are bolder on visionOS by default][TextWeight]

[TextWeight]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10076/TextWeight.png

- Semantic names
- Point based unit sytem
- see: [Principles of spatial design](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10072/)
- Font weight
- Modified to be slightly heavier on visionOS
- Body is semibold by default
- Extra Large Title Styles
- Editorial
- Use bolder font weights for legibility

### Vibrancy
- Updates in real time
- Works on top of the glass material
- Use system components when possible
- Takes advantage of vibrancy by default
- Three modes:
- `primary`: for standard text
- `secondary`: for descriptions, footnotes, subtitles
- `tertiary`

### Colors
- Consider using white text or symbols
- For color
- Use it in a full button rather than just text
- System colors adjust hue/vibrancy based on background

![Don't: Use color in a button label, Do: Use color in a buttons background][ColoredButtons]

[ColoredButtons]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10076/ColoredButtons.png

## Layout

### Ergonomics
- Left and right neck motion is easier than up and down
- Use wider aspect ratios than taller
- Center important information in your app

### Sizing
- Use sizes that are easy to target
- Tap targets should be at least 60x60 points of tappable space.
- 44 point buttons should have at least 8 points of space around it

![][ButtonTargetArea]

[ButtonTargetArea]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10076/ButtonTargetArea.png

- Buttons in stacks should have at least 16 points of space around them

![][ButtonsGap]

[ButtonsGap]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10076/ButtonsGap.png

- Mini buttons like 28 pixel size in section headers may look small but they have at least 60 points of space around them
- Large and XL buttons require less spacing around them
- Give interactive elements at least 60 points of space

### Focus feedback
- Hover effect is automatic
- Disabled buttons don’t have a hover effect
- Lists and menus should have 4 points of space for the hover effect

![][ButtonContainerGap]

[ButtonContainerGap]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10076/ButtonContainerGap.png

- Same for a lockup like Music.
- Define a custom region for a single selectable element.
- Nested elements should have concentric continuous corners.

![][NestedCornerRadius]

[NestedCornerRadius]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10076/NestedCornerRadius.png

- inner corner radius + padding = outer corner radius

![][OutsideCornerRadiusCalc]

[OutsideCornerRadiusCalc]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10076/OutsideCornerRadiusCalc.png

- Every element is concentric to its nested elements

## From screen to spatial

### Inputs
- Most interaction happens at a distance
- Additionally, direct interaction or keyboard / trackpad
- Use system components
- see: [Design for spatial input](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10073/)

![A slide showing a bunch of different system components][SystemComponents]

[SystemComponents]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10076/SystemComponents.png

### Window
- made of glass material
- with window bar below

### Tab bar
- Vertical and fixed on the left side of Windows
- Avoid having more than 6 items
- Long looks shows labels for each section (automatic expand & collapse)

![A tab bar in its automatically expanded style when looking at it for longer][TabBarLongLook]

[TabBarLongLook]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10076/TabBarLongLook.png

### Side bar
- Used to provide sub navigation from the tab bar

### Ornaments

- Replaced for segmented controls in iOS
- Positioned outside the window with depth, at the bottom
- Great for toolbars
- Usually a collection of buttons: Borderless buttons

![Don't: Add border around icons in ornaments, Do: use borderless buttons in ornaments][OrnamentButtons]

[OrnamentButtons]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10076/OrnamentButtons.png

- Examples: Years/Months/Days in Photos, Playback Controls in Music
- At the bottom: Overlap by 20 points

![Ornaments overlapping window by 20 points][OrnamentGap]

[OrnamentGap]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10076/OrnamentGap.png

- Only hide ornaments when looking at a single piece of content
- Ornaments can expand or have navigation hierarchy

### Menus and Popover
- Centered
- Can expand outside the window
- Buttons should be selected when the menu or popover is open
- Avoid using buttons with white backgrounds unless selected

### Sheets
- Centered
- Maintain z position of the window and the window pushes back
- Secondary modal cal be used with additional dimming

![A paywall sheet in the Music app with another payment confirmation sheet on top][NestedModals]

[NestedModals]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10076/NestedModals.png

- Consider push navigation within modals
- Close and back buttons should be in the top left
- "Pushing" a view onto the stack uses "cross dissolve" animation instead of moving to right

### Outside windows

![A view showing content in the Photos app that with an 'Expand View' button for a more immersive experience][OutsideViews]

[OutsideViews]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10076/OutsideViews.png

- Spatial Captures, can be expanded
