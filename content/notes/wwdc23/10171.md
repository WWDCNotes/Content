## Challenges of defining an API

![API definition: Serve URL, API endpoint, HTTP method, Path parameters, Query string, HTTP header fields, Content type, Request body, Status codes, Response body, Errors, Required parameters, Optional parameters, Encoding, Authorization, API version, ...][api-definition-challenges]

- Most services have some kind of documentation, but hand-written can be outdated
- With access to source code, implementation can be used – but incomplete understanding
- Support forums might help, but those who help might be underinformed
-> incomplete picture

## Exploring OpenAPI

- Tried-and-tested Industry-standard 
- You declare your API in YAML or JSON
- Rich ecosystem of tooling
- Known for interdactive doucmentation
- Core motivation is code generation
- Without OpenAPI, creating query & interpreting the response can be complex
- Working with larger APIs detracts from the core logic of the app

Example OpenAPI document:

```yaml
openapi: "3.0.3"
info:
  title: "GreetingService"
  version: "1.0.0"
servers:
- url: "http://localhost:8080/api"
  description: "Production"
paths:
  /greet:
    get:
      operationId: "getGreeting"
      parameters:
      - name: "name"
        required: false
        in: "query"
        description: "Personalizes the greeting."
        schema:
          type: "string"
      responses:
        "200":
          description: "Returns a greeting"
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: "#/components/schemas/Greeting" 
```

With the help of an OpenAPI Generator complex API handling can become as simple as this with safe types:

```Swift
switch try await client.getGreeting(Operations.getGreeting.Input(query: Operations.getGreeting.Input.Query(name: "Jane"))) {
case .ok(let response):
	switch response.body {
		case .json(let greeting):
		print(greeting.message)
	}
}
```

- Swift OpenAPI Generator is a Swift package plugin, generates code at build time
- Always in sync with OpenAPI document, no need to commit code to source control

## Making API calls from your app

- To use OpenAPI Generator, add package to your app from `https://github.com/apple-swift-openapi-generator`
- Next, add also the package from `https://github.com/swift-openapi-runtime` to your app
- Lastly, add also the package from `https://github.com/swift-openapi-urlsession` for the code to be generated for `URLSession`
- In "Build Phases", in the "Run Build Tool Plug-Ins", add `OpenAPIGenerator`

![][build-tool-plugins]

[build-tool-plugins]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10171/build-tool-plugins.png

- The plugin expects 2 files in project: `openapi-generator-config.yaml` (config) and `openapi.yaml` (spec)
- The config file specifies what code to generate, e.g. `generate: [types, client]`
- In SwiftUI, import `OpenAPIRuntime` and `OpenAPIURLSession`, then initialize a `Client(severURL: ..., transport: URLSessionTransport())`
- Now you can call the API using `try await client.getEmoji(Operations.getEmoji.Input())` or with whatever endpoints are defined in the spec
- The reponse of this call is an enum with all possible cases documented + content types -> forces us to handle all scenarios
- To also handle any behavior that is not documented, there's `.undocumented(statusCode:_:)` to handle it gracefully


## Adapting as the API evolves

- For example, when adding a new parameter to the API document like `count`
- The generated Swift code will force you to add the parameter in all places where needed, else Swift fails


## Testing your app with mocks

- Define `MockClient: APIProtocol`, the compiler will give you errors and fix-its to fill in the APIs you need
- Make the view generic over `C: APIProtocol` like in `struct ContentView<C: APIProtocol>: View`
- Update your `client` property to use the generic type `C` instead
- Define a new initializer where the client is passed (`init(client: C)`) for dependency injection
- Use `where C == Client` on default initializer to use real server when app launched
- Pass `MockClient()` when previewing the UI in Xcode

## Server development in Swift

All the code needed to write a simple test server using the OpenAPI generator that handles the requests is this:

```Swift
import Foundation
import OpenAPIRuntime
import OpenAPIVapor
import Vapor

struct Handler: APIProtocol {
    func getEmoji(_ input: Operations.getEmoji.Input) async throws -> Operations.getEmoji.Output {
        let candidates = "🐱😹😻🙀😿😽😸😺😾😼"
        let chosen = String(candidates.randomElement()!)
        let count = input.query.count ?? 1
        let emojis = String(repeating: chosen, count: count)
        return .ok(Operations.getEmoji.Output.Ok(body: .text(emojis)))
    }
}

@main
struct CatService {
    public static func main() throws {
        let app = Vapor.Application()
        let transport = VaporTransport(routesBuilder: app)
        let handler = Handler()
        try handler.registerHandlers(on: transport, serverURL: Servers.server1())
        try app.run()
    }
}
```

The related `Package.swift` file of the server package looks like this:

```Swift
// swift-tools-version: 5.8
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "CatService",
    platforms: [
        .macOS(.v13),
    ],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-openapi-generator", .upToNextMinor(from: "0.1.0")),
        .package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-openapi-runtime", .upToNextMinor(from: "0.1.0")),
        .package(url: "https://github.com/swift-server/swift-openapi-vapor", .upToNextMinor(from: "0.1.0")),
        .package(url: "https://github.com/vapor/vapor", .upToNextMajor(from: "4.69.2")),
    ],
    targets: [
        .executableTarget(
            name: "CatService",
            dependencies: [
                .product(name: "OpenAPIRuntime", package: "swift-openapi-runtime"),
                .product(name: "OpenAPIVapor", package: "swift-openapi-vapor"),
                .product(name: "Vapor", package: "vapor"),
            ],
            resources: [.process("Resources/cat.mp4")],
            plugins: [.plugin(name: "OpenAPIGenerator", package: "swift-openapi-generator")]
        ),
    ]
)
```

Additionally, on the `openapi-generator-config.yaml` file, instead of `client`, add `server` for the right code to be generated (alongside `types`).

Like on the client side, when making changes to the API spec, like adding new endpoints, the server package build will fail and offer fix-its to add the missing parts.

## Main Takeaway

Start with defining the OpenAPI doc to use this kind of flow saving you time on both the client & server. This is called "Spec-Driven Development".
