Object Capture utilizes cutting-edge computer vision technologies to generate realistic 3D models from a series of images captured from different angles. Initially introduced for macOS in WWDC21, it is now also available for iOS 17 and above.

> For a recap, watch [Create 3D models with Object Capture](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10076).

To showcase this new capability for iOS, Apple has provided a sample app that allows you to learn and adapt it to your own apps. Follow this [link](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/guided-capture-sample) to download the project and read the explanation below to understand how to capture objects and how this sample app works internally.

# System Requirements

The sample cannot run on a simulator, if you want to try it out, you will meet the following requirements:
- iOS or iPadOS 17.
- iPhone 12 Pro, iPad Pro 2021, or any later device with LiDAR Sensor.
> You can even compile the sample app on a device that doesn't meet those requirements, but it will crash when attempting to start capturing

# Steps to scan objects using the demo app

1. Open the app and point it at the object.

![Point to the object][capture-object-1]

[capture-object-1]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10191/capture-object-1.png

2. An automatic bounding box will be generated before starting the capture. You can adjust the edges to define the scanning area.

![Bounding box][capture-object-2]

[capture-object-2]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10191/capture-object-2.png

3. The app will guide you through the regions that require more image scanning.

![Scanning Regions][capture-object-3]

4. The app provides feedback to help you capture high-quality shots.

5. After completing the first scanning, you can flip the object to capture the bottom (if necessary).

![Flipping Object][capture-object-5]

6. The app requires two more scan rounds. Once all scans are completed, the app will start generating the 3D object model. This process may take a few minutes.

7. Once the processing is complete, the app will provide a visualization of your new 3D model and you will be able to save it as a usdz file.

# Support for more objects with LiDAR

- The LiDAR Scanner has received improvements to scan and reconstruct low-texture objects, as demonstrated with the chair image.

![Chair with low textures][capture-object-8]

[capture-object-8]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10191/capture-object-8.png

- Although low-texture objects are supported, scanning certain objects still presents challenges. It is best to avoid objects that are reflective, transparent, or have thin structures.


# Flippable Objects

- Textured and rigid objects are ideal for capturing the bottom side. However, objects with repetitive textures, deformable objects, and textureless objects are not recommended for flipping.

![Flippable vs Non-flipabble objects][capture-object-9]

[capture-object-9]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10191/capture-object-9.png

- When flipping an object, it is advisable to use diffuse lights to minimize shadow and reflections on the object's surface.

# Non-flippable Objects

- For non-flippable objects, it is recommended to scan them from three different heights and place them against a textured background to enhance visibility.

# Object Capture API

The Object Capture API consists of two steps:
1. Image Capture
2. Model Reconstruction

# Image Capture API

- The Image Capture API comprises two parts: the session from `ObjectCaptureSession`, which allows you to control the flow of a state machine during image capture, and the SwiftUI View `ObjectCaptureView`, which displays the camera feed and adapts UI elements based on the session's state.
- The session progresses through various states, including initializing, ready, detecting, capturing, finishing, completed, and failed (for errors).
 
## Adding Capture Object API to your app

To get started, you need to first import RealityKit and SwiftUI, and then create a session object:

```swift
import RealityKit
import SwiftUI 

var session = ObjectCaptureSession()
```

> Since `ObjectCaptureSession` is a reference type, it is important to keep it alive through `@StateObject` until the capture process is completed.

These are the different session states:

![Session States][session-states]

[session-states]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10191/session-states.png

Continuing, call the `start` method with a directory indicating where to store the captured images:

```swift
var configuration = ObjectCaptureSession.Configuration()
configuration.checkpointDirectory = getDocumentsDir().appendingPathComponent("Snapshots/")

session.start(imagesDirectory: getDocumentsDir().appendingPathComponent("Images/"),
            configuration: configuration)
```

  Once this call is done, it will move to `ready` state.

 > You can also provide a checkpoint directory to speed up the reconstruction process.
  
Next, create an `ObjectCaptureView` and provide the session object. This view should be wrapped within another SwiftUI view:

```swift
import RealityKit
import SwiftUI

struct CapturePrimaryView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            ObjectCaptureView(session: session)
        }
    }
}
```

`ObjectCaptureView` displays the UI corresponding to the current session state.

To start detecting the object, call `session.startDetecting()` from the UI:

```swift
var body: some View {
    ZStack {
        ObjectCaptureView(session: session)
        if case .ready = session.state {
            CreateButton(label: "Continue") { 
                session.startDetecting() 
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this state, the bounding box is displayed, allowing you to adjust the capture edges.
    - To capture a different object, call `session.resetDetection()` to return to the `ready` state:

```swift
Button {
    session.resetDetection()
} label: {
    Text("Reset")
}
```
Once the bounding box is adjusted, call `session.startCapturing()` from the UI to progress to the next state:

```swift
var body: some View {
    ZStack {
        ObjectCaptureView(session: session)
        if case .ready = session.state {
            CreateButton(label: "Continue") { 
                session.startDetecting()
            }
        } else if case .detecting = session.state {
            CreateButton(label: "Start Capture") { 
                session.startCapturing()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The session will automatically capture images while you slowly move around the object. `ObjectCaptureView` provides a dial indicating areas that require scanning.

Once the scanning is complete, `session.userCompletedScanPass` is set to `true`:

```swift
var body: some View {
    if session.userCompletedScanPass {
        VStack {
        }
    } else {
        ZStack {
            ObjectCaptureView(session: session)
        }
    }
}
```

The session can detect if the scanned object needs to be flipped to capture parts not yet visible to the camera, such as the bottom. This can be determined using `ObjectCaptureSession.Feedback` and checking if `session.feedback.contains(.objectNotFlippable)`:

```swift
if !session.feedback.contains(.objectNotFlippable) && !hasIndicatedFlipObjectAnyway {
    session.beginNewScanPass()
} else {
    session.beginNewScanPassAfterFlip()
}
```

If the user decides to flip the object, `beginNewScanPassAfterFlip()` sets the session back to the ready state to adjust the bounding box for the new orientation. Otherwise, `beginNewScanPass()` keeps the session in the capturing state, allowing capturing from different heights while maintaining the same bounding box.

Once the three scans are completed, the sample app provides a button to end the session by calling `session.finish()`. This transitions the session to the finishing state:

```swift
var body: some View {
    if session.userCompletedScanPass {
        VStack {
            CreateButton(label: "Finish") {
                session.finish() 
            }
        }
    } else {
        ZStack {
            ObjectCaptureView(session: session)
        }
    }
}
```

Once the process is finished, the session automatically moves to the `completed` state, triggering on-device reconstruction.

> If an error occurs during the process, the session enters into failed state, requiring the creation of a new session.

Optionally, you can use `ObjectCapturePointCloudView` to preview the scanned parts of the object since its initial placement or last flip:

```swift
var body: some View {
    if session.userCompletedScanPass {
        VStack {
            ObjectCapturePointCloudView(session: session)
            CreateButton(label: "Finish") {
                session.finish() 
            }
        }
    } else {    
        ZStack {
            ObjectCaptureView(session: session)
        }
    }
}
```

## Model Reconstruction API

The following code from the sample app initiates the reconstruction process, applicable for both iOS and macOS:

```swift
var body: some View {
  ReconstructionProgressView()
      .task { // 1
          var configuration = PhotogrammetrySession.Configuration() 
          configuration.checkpointDirectory = getDocumentsDir()
              .appendingPathComponent("Snapshots/") // 3
          let session = try PhotogrammetrySession( // 2
              input: getDocumentsDir().appendingPathComponent("Images/"),
              configuration: configuration)
          try session.process(requests: [ // 4
              .modelFile(url: getDocumentsDir().appendingPathComponent("model.usdz")) 
          ])
          for try await output in session.outputs { // 5
              switch output {
                  case .processingComplete:
                      handleComplete()
                      // Handle other Output messages here.
              }
          }
      }
}
```

1. The `task` modifier is attached to `ReconstructionProgressView`.
2. A new `PhotogrammetrySession` is created, pointing to the images.
3. Optionally, the same checkpoint directory used during image capture can be provided to expedite the reconstruction process.
4. The `process` function is called to request a model file.
5. Finally, the message stream is awaited in an asynchronous loop, and output messages are handled as they arrive.

# Detail level on iOS

To optimize model generation and viewing on mobile devices, iOS supports a reduced detail level. The reconstruction model includes the following texture maps: [Diffuse](https://docs.cryengine.com/display/SDKDOC2/Diffuse+Maps), [ambient occlusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_occlusion), and [normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_mapping). If you require a higher level of detail, you must transfer your images to macOS for reconstruction.

# Capturing for Mac

Starting from 2023, Mac reconstruction also utilizes the saved LiDAR data in the images. By default, `ObjectCaptureSession` stops capturing images when the reconstruction limit for the iOS device is reached. However, for macOS, you can allow the session to capture more images than on-device reconstruction can use by setting `isOverCaptureEnabled` to `true` in the session's configurations:

```swift
var configuration = ObjectCaptureSession.Configuration()
configuration.isOverCaptureEnabled = true

session.start(imagesDirectory: getDocumentsDir().appendingPathComponent("Images/"),
            configuration: configuration)
```

These additional shots are not used for on-device reconstruction but are stored in the Images folder.

# Model Reconstruction in Mac

No code is required. Simply import the images into Reality Composer Pro, choose a detail level, and obtain your model!

# Reconstruction Enhancements

- Improved performance and image quality on Mac.
- The API now provides an estimated processing time in addition to progress percentage.
- High-quality poses can now be requested for each image, including the estimated position and orientation of the camera for that image.
- To obtain the poses, add `.poses` to the `process()` function call and handle them when they arrive in the message stream:

```swift
try session.process(requests: [ 
    .poses 
    .modelFile(url: modelURL),
])
for try await output in session.outputs {
    switch output {
    case .poses(let poses):
        handlePoses(poses)
    case .processingComplete:
        handleComplete()
    }
}
```

- The API now provides a new custom detail level to control the amount of mesh decimation, texture map resolution, format, and which texture maps should be included.
