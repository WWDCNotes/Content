> While spatial computing experiences are often built with stunning visual features and a variety of hand inputs, that doesn't mean that vision or physical movement are required to engage with them. In fact, these experiences have the potential to be incredibly impactful to people who are blind or low vision, have limited mobility, or limb differences. 

- visionOS has the biggest list of accessibility features ever included in a first generation of a product.
- Some of the most popular assistive technologies have been reimagined for spatial computing.

## Vision accessibility

Support people who are blind or low vision

### VoiceOver support

- VoiceOver is the built-in screen reader on all Apple platforms. It has also been included in visionOS.
- Can be added to the Accessibility Shortcut in `Settings > Accessibility > Accessibility Shortcut`

![VoiceOver Accessibility Shortcut in Settings][VoiceOver_Accessibility_Shortcut]

[VoiceOver_Accessibility_shortcut]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10034/VoiceOver_Accessibility_Shortcut.png

- Triple-press on the Digital Crown will turn on or off VoiceOver
- Use different finger pinches on different hands to perform different actions
- Pinching your right index finger or right middle finger shifts focus to the next or previous item
- To activate an item, pinch your right ring finger or left index finger

SwiftUI can be used to build visionOS apps[^1]
- It's best to use standard controls
- Adopt accessibility modifiers

**NEW** Accessibility component in RealityKit allows to configure accessibility properties on RealityKit entities
- Label, value, traits[^2]
- Custom rotors, custom actions, custom content[^3]
- System actions
```swift
// RealityKit AccessibilityComponent API

var accessibilityComponent = AccessibilityComponent()
accessibilityComponent.isAccessibilityElement = true
accessibilityComponent.traits = [.button, .playsSound]
accessibilityComponent.label = "Cloud"
accessibilityComponent.value = "Grumpy"
cloud.components[AccessibilityComponent.self] = accessibilityComponent
```

Whenever the app state changes, update the relevant property on the accessibility component
```swift
var isHappy: Bool {
  didSet {
    cloudEntities[id].accessibilityValue = isHappy ? "Happy" : "Grumpy"
  }
}
```

> **Warning**
> In spatial experiences, it's critical to provide information about what items are available and where they are located

- VoiceOver uses Spatial Audio to provide cues as to where objects are located
- When VoiceOver is enabled, it does not receive hand input by default
- **NEW** Direct Gesture Mode
	- App receives hand input
	- VoiceOver does not process its own gestures
	- People can choose to run your app in Direct Gesture Mode or Voice Overs default interaction mode
	- Post announcements that describe the scene 
    ```swift 
	AccessibilityNotification
	    .Announcement("8 clouds in front of you").post()
    ```
	- Announce meaningful events
	- Announce changes in context
	- Use sounds

### Visual design[^4]
- Support Dynamic Type
- Alternate layouts at largest accessibility text sizes
- 4:1 contrast ratio between foreground and background color

Head anchors
- Use them sparingly
- Zoom accessibility feature is head anchored
- **Avoid critical information in head-anchored UI**
- **NEW** Provide alternatives
  ```swift
  // SwiftUI
  @Environment(\.accessibilityPrefersHeadAnchorAlternative)
  private var accessibilityPrefersHeadAnchorAlternative
  
  // UIKit
  AXPrefersHeadAnchorAlternative()
  NSNotification.Name.AXPrefersHeadAnchorAlternativeDidChange
  ```

### Motion

Even when motion effects are used subtlety, it can be a jarring experience for some people to wear a headset. Avoid:
- Rapid movement
- Bouncing/wave-like movement
- Zooming animations
- Multi-axis movement
- Spinning/rotation effects
- Persistent background effects

Provide alternatives when Reduce Motion is enabled
```swift
// SwiftuI
@Environment(\.accessibilityReduceMotion)
private var accessibilityReduceMotion

// UIKit
UlAccessibility.isReduceMotionEnabled
UlAccessibility. reduceMotionStatusDidChangeNotification
```

![Reduce Motion accessibility settings][Reduce_Motion]

If you can't find a good replacement for the motion in your app, try using a crossfade.
