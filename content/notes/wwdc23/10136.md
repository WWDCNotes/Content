## Presenter Overlay

- Elevates the presenters presence by including presenter on top of shared content
- Small overlay: Places presenter in a movable window

- Large overlay: Separates the presenters face & body from the background & layers screen content between them (more immersive)

- Overlay integrated in `SCStream` – video menu bar will show automatically, user controls sharing there

- User can control the stream there & customize things like camera / microphone effects
- Currently content frames sent to its process from ScreenCaptureKit
- Now when camera is started overlay available in video menu item
- ScreenCaptureKit will take the camera and apply the rendering to the selected stream – composite frames are automatic

![][flow]

- Apps get notified about presenter overlay started/stopped via `SCStream` delegate method `stream(_:outputEffectDidStart:)`
- Considerations to take: Hide camera view when turned on, update app UI, optimize experience (higher frame rates)

## Screen sharing picker

- `SCContentFilter` from `SCShareableContent` used, new: get content filter from the picker
- Content can now also be picked from window menu directly
- New `SCContentSharingPicker` acts as interface between app and OS
- Built-in system-level content picker
- Comes with per-stream customization

Usage example:
```Swift
// Set up content sharing picker instance
let picker = SCContentSharingPicker.shared()
picker.addObserver(self)
picker.active = true

// show system level picker button
func showSystemPicker(sender: UIButton!) {
    picker.present(for stream: nil, using contentStyle:.window)
}

// observer call back for picker
func contentSharingPicker(_ picker: SCContentSharingPicker, didUpdateWith filter:                                          
SCContentFilter, for stream: SCStream?) {
   if let stream = stream {
        stream.updateContentFilter(filter)
    } else {
        let stream = SCStream(filter: filter, configuration: config, delegate: self)
    }
}
```

- There are also `didFailWith error` and `didCancel for stream` delegate methods
- Use `SCContentSharingPickerConfiguration` with options like `excludedBundleIDs` or `allowsRepicking` to configure

## Screenshot

- Features like advanced rendering by app or window, multiple pixel formats & color spaces, cursor visibility etc. are available
- New API is asynchronous, choose between `CMSampleBuffer` (has format options) and `CGImage`
- Similar options & setup flow as screen capture
- Transition from `CGWindowListCreateImage` by using options in `SCStreamConfiguration`
- List options provided in `SCShareableContent`
- There's a `CGImage` output format to migrate
- To start, use `SCShareableContent` with `SCContentFilter` and `SCStreamConfiguration`
- Then call `SCScreenshotManager.captureScreenshot` class method to receive a screenshot
- You can also use the new system picker to create the `SCContentFilter` instead of `SCShareableContent`

Taking a screenshot:

```Swift
// Don't forget to customize the content you want in your screenshot
// Use SCShareableContent or SCContentSharingPicker to pick your content
let display = nil;

// Create your SCContentFilter and SCStreamConfiguration
// Customize these lines to use the content you want and desired config options
let myContentFilter = SCContentFilter(display: display,
                             excludingApplications: [],
                             exceptingWindows: []);
let myConfiguration = SCStreamConfiguration();

// Call the screenshot API and get your screenshot image
if let screenshot = try? await SCScreenshotManager.capture<#SampleBuffer|Image#>(contentFilter: myContentFilter, configuration:
                                                       myConfiguration) {
    print("Fetched screenshot.")
} else {
    print("Failed to fetch screenshot.")
}
```
