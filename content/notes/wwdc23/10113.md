## Introduction

There are 3 ways to display content in visionOS:
- **Window**: 2D content
- **Volume**: bounded 3D experiences
- **Full Space**: display of unbounded 3D content

This talk focuses on **Volumes**.

## Volumes

- Can use without any windows
- Provides a fixed scale container
- Unlike windows, maintains the same size at any distance
- Horizontally aligned, and support viewing from any angle
- Doesn't take over the entire space
- Use `.windowStyle(.volumetric)` modifier on a WindowGroup

## 3D views and layout

#### Model3D

- A RealityKit view to load simple 3D scenes asynchronously
- Similar to `AsyncImage`, you can use placeholders during loading
- Use `.resizable` modifier with model, similar to `Image`
- Default alignment is against back plane. Otherwise, use `.frame(depth:alignment:)` with `.front` alignment
- Can use `.glassBackgroundEffect()` to make text labels readable in visionOS

## RealityView

Use for more involved 3D scenes

Can use RealityKit's Entity-Component system for advanced rendering

#### RealityView attachments

- Pair tagged (`.tag`) SwiftUI views with Entity inside RealityView
- Useful for adding annotations or editing affordances
- These live views can respond to state changes, run animations, and handle gestures

## 3D gestures

- Existing gestures supported in 3D
- Hands, eyes, trackpad mechanics supported

Add `InputTargetComponent` to RealityKit Entity to receive input

`CollisionComponent` is used to define shape of entity's interactive region

Can use `SpatialTapGesture` to allow user to interact with entity

`.targetedToEntity` modifier ties gestures to specific entities

Convert from SwiftUI local space to scene's coordinate space

Instead of loading another model using RealityKit, you can add a `Model3D` as an attachment

`RotateGesture3D` is another new gesture you can use
