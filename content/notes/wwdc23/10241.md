### Limitations of GroupSessionManager

Previously, if you were creating a group drawing app and wanted to drop a photo onto the canvas, this wasn't possible due to the size limitations of `GroupSessionManager`.

New in iOS17, file attachment transfers are not only possible but are very fast and end to end encrypted.

### GroupSessionJournal

New to iOS17. `GroupSessionJournal` an object that stays consistent for everyone across the `GroupSession`. Actions you take on the journal affect everyone and properties on the journal are similarly synced for everyone.

```swift
public final class GroupSessionJournal {
    public lazy var attachments: Attachments
    public func add‹ItemType: Transferable>(_ item: ItemType) async throws → Attachment
    public func remove(attachment: Attachment) async throws
}
```

You can upload any of your custom attachments with the "add" function. Just be sure your type conforms to the `Transferable` protocol. 

When calling `add` or`remove` everyone in the GroupSession will observe their "attachments" AsyncSequence being updated with the event.

- Attachments are limited to 100MB.
- The lifecycle of the attachment is as long as members of the `GroupSession` are connected
	- If the person who uploaded the attachment leaves the `GroupSession` the attachment remains until everyone disconnects

### GroupSessionJournal: Late Joiners

Another advantage of `GroupSessionJournal` over `GroupSessionMessenger` is how it handles late joiners. 

In `GroupSessionMessenger`, late joiners are "caught up" on the session by having each session member re-upload their interactions behind the scenes. Obviously, having each member re-upload 100MB file attachments is not efficient so `GroupSessionJournal` ensures that late joiners receive attachments without any re-uploads. 

### Code Example: Syncing an image and it's location across devices

1) Create a struct for the image data and add it to your Canvas model

```swift
struct CanvasImage: Identifiable {
    var id: UUID
    let location: CGPoint
    let imageData: Data
}

class Canvas: ObservableObject {
    @Published var images = [CanvasImage]()
    //...
}
```

2) In your Canvas model, setup your `GroupSessionJournal` and listen for changes to its attachments

```swift
func configureGroupSession(_ groupSession: GroupSession<DrawTogether>) {
    self.groupSession = groupSession
    let messenger = GroupSessionMessenger(session: groupSession)
    self.messenger = messenger
    let journal = GroupSessionJournal(session: groupSession)
    self.journal = journal
    
    //set up groupSession, handle messenger events...
    
    task = Task {
        for await images in journal.attachments {
            await handle(images)
        }
    }
    tasks.insert(task)

    //...
}
```

3) In your Canvas model, create the image handler to convert journal attachments to `CanvasImage`

```swift
func handle(_ attachments: GroupSessionJournal.Attachments.Element) async {
    // Now make sure that our canvas always has all the images from this sequence.
    self.images = await withTaskGroup(of: CanvasImage?.self) { group in
        var images = [CanvasImage]()
        attachments.forEach { attachment in
            group.addTask {
                do {
                    let metadata = try await attachment.loadMetadata(
                        of: ImageMetadataMessage.self
                    )
                    let imageData = try await attachment.load(
                        Data.self
                    )
                    return .init(
                        id: attachment.id,
                        location: metadata.location,
                        imageData: imageData
                    )
                } catch { return nil }
            }
            for await image in group {
                if let image {
                    images.append(image)
                }
            }
            return images
        }
    }
}
```

4) At this stage, simply update your UI to reflect Canvas.images
