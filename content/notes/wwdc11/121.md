## UIView and CALayer

- `UIView` and `CALayer` have a separate hierarchy
- each `UIView` is backed by a `CALayer`
- different `UIView` subclasses might use a different `CALayer` subclass. The recommended way is to add another `CALayer` as a sub-layer of the `UIView`'s `CALayer`

### Geometry differences

`UIView`s use UIkit points (where points != pixels), while `CALayer`s use the actual pixels size.  
For example, a full screen `UIView` on iPhone 4 has <kbd>320x480</kbd> points, but the `CALayer` size will be <kbd>640x960</kbd>

The origin on `UIView` is always top left (on portrait in 2011, in newer version of iOS it will be always top-left, regardless of the orientation), while on `CALayer` might be different (e.g. top right on portrait on the original iPad, bottom left on the iPad 2). It's recommended to always use UIkit for sizing, positioning, as it will be more consistent.

#### `UIView`'s `frame`

`UIView`'s [`frame`][frame] is the smallest rectangle that fully encloses that view from the `UIView`'s `superview` coordinate system. 

By default, this is equivalent to the location (`frame.origin`) and size (`frame.size`) of the `UIView` in its `superview`.

However, `UIView`'s `frame` is actually a computed property, setting the frame changes the view's..:

1. ...[`center`][center], which is a point in the `superview` which defines the location of the center of your view
2. ...[`bounds`][bounds], which is a `CGRect` in the view's own coordinate space, the `frame.size` is set on the `bounds.size` and represent the view size before taking account of any transform applied to the view

Note that the `frame` takes in consideration any transform applied to the view.  
If we scale the sub-view to 50% for example, the `frame` will report a `frame.size` that is half the `bounds.size`, and an `frame.origin` that is the shifted to according to the new `size` and the old `center` point.
If we rotate the sub-view, the `frame` will need to enlarge to cover all the corners of the rotated view.

> This is because any transform is applied according to the center to the view.

#### Components of `frame`

| `UIView` Property | `CALayer` Property | Coordinate Space |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bounds.size` | `bounds.size` |  View |
| `center` | `position` | Superview |
| `transform` | `affineTransform` | Superview |
| `transform3D` | `transform` | Superlayer |
| | `anchorPoint` | Layer (Unit Coordinates) |

`CALayer`'s [`anchorPoint`][anchorpoint] is a point in the `CALayer` defined in unit coordinates that determines the point in the view that will get anchored to the superview at that view `position`. In other words, it tells what is the location in the layer that corresponds to the `CALayer`'s `position`.

#### `UIView`'s `bounds` `origin`

When it's not zero, you can consider it as applying a translation (of `origin`) to all the subviews of that view.
In other words, this changes the point in the view own coordinate system that is visible at the top left of the frame.

In conclusion, `bounds` define which portion of the view coordinate system is visible in the view's frame

### Drawing

What we render on screen is `UIView`'s (CA)layer [`contents`][contents] property (`view.layer.contents`). `UIView` provides various wrappers around this property, and you almost never set its content directly yourself.

The most common ways to render things on screen is to:

- (for static content) use `UIImageView`
- (for dynamic content) subclass `UIView` and override/implement `drawRect:` (which is drawing with `CoreGraphics`)

Note that `UIImageView` can animate and usually is more memory efficient (like tiling and stretching images)

## [`CATransaction`][CATransaction]

- Used behind the scenes in `UIView`/`CALayer`
- when we change something in `UIView`/`CALayer`, an implicit `CATransaction` will start, and that same transaction will commit at the end of that run loop

## Quality and Performance

The best thing we can do to improve our UI app performance is to avoid offscreen rendering.

Ideally our screens would render without any offscreen passes, however this doesn't happen because we need to do some extra work on our views such as blending, transparency, clipping, transforming etc.

One way to solve this is to use layer rasterization, via `[CALayer setShouldRasterize:]`, which tells Core Animation to cache/buffer the first rendering and use it for the next renderings.

### Clipping and masking

- `- [CALayer cornerRadius]`
- `- [CALayer mask]`
- `- [UIView clipsToBounds]` (`- [CALayer masksToBounds]`)

For example when we set the layer `cornerRadius`, this cause offscreen passes when the layer (view) contains sub-layers (subviews).

Tricks to avoid offscreen passes:

- `- [CALayer contentsRect]`, defines what part of the content gets rendered
- `- [UIView drawRect:]`, we render our expensive mask/cornerradius etx upfront, to avoid having to do them at each frame
- Transparent overlay, add a transparent layer on top of yours that masks the part you want to hide from your layer

### Group opacity

![][opacity.png]

Using group opacity, will flat the view before applying the alpha to it.

When we apply an `alpha` to a `UIView`, UIKit multiplies recursively that alpha to all subviews.

To enable group opacity on UIKit, use one of the following:

- set [<kbd>UIViewGroupOpacity</kbd>][UIViewGroupOpacity] in your <kbd>Info.plist</kbd>
- Pre-render in `drawRect:`
- (static content) set `layer.shouldRasterize = YES`

### Shadows

`layer.shadowOffset` and `layer.shadowColor` are very convenient, but very expensive. 

To improve use:

- `- [CALayer shadowPath]`
- `- [CALayer shouldRasterize]`
- CoreGraphics shadows via `CGContextSetShadow` (in `drawRect:`)

### Edge anti-aliasing

- Set [`UIViewEdgeAntialiasing`][UIViewEdgeAntialiasing] key in your <kbd>Info.plist</kbd>
- Fake it with a pixel border
