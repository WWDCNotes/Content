- “Design through the lens of language”
- All Apple devices greet with “hello” (like the original Mac)
- An app with the words removed looks empty (proves the point how important words are)

- Structure, timing and feeling people have are important, too
- Make writing an early part of your design process, not something you fill in later

## Purpose

- Consider information hierarchy (order of elements in a screen)
    - People don’t read text in a screen in order
    - e.g. a large bottom button is seen faster

- Know what to leave out
    - Don’t show too much text, focus on the purpose of the screen
    - e.g. “iPhone Needs to Cool Down” screen with information about details why it is and a large emergency button
    - Aim for simplicity

- Have a purpose for every screen
    - Both for a whole flow and all screens, have a clear purpose
    - Don’t use multiple screens for one purpose
    - Represent your apps values (like privacy) and show throughout

## Anticipation

- Think of a conversation (= your app having a conversation with user)
    - e.g. changing alarm schedule provides “just next day”
    - or the sleep screen says “Sleep Well”
    - iPhone asks when you’re awake early “Turn Off Alarm?”

- Develop your voice and vary your tone (according to situation)
    - Game is friendly, Banking app is secure and trustworthy etc.
    - e.g. “it looks like you’ve taken a hard fall.” → “I’m OK” – being calm in a stressful moment
    - e.g. “You set a personal record for your longest daily Move streak: 35 days!” – exclamation point used to sound motivational – but don’t overuse, can be silly

- Know what to say
    - “No inhale…” “and exhale” in Breathe app
    - “8 mins to Home”, “Take Audubon Ave, traffic is light” → clear what to do next

## Context

- Think outside the app
    - Are your users likely to be home, or in airport, cooking?
    - “It looks like you’re working out.” “Record outdoor walk” → you’re on the go, keep it simple
    - Summary of sports has more details, as you’re home
    - When taking a panorama, words appear right below arrow, because that’s where you’re looking

- Write helpful alerts
    - e.g. “Allow Weather to also user your location …” on app start
    - “Remove iPhone?” with “Remove” and “Cancel” buttons, mark destructive buttons red and put to left
    - “Confirm Cancellation” → “Cancel” | “Confirm” → hard to know what to do – detail text isn’t really helpful
    - Better to be explicit: “Cancel Subscription” and “Keep Subscription”
    - and make clear which plan instead of “this” plan
    - Never label alert buttons “Yes” and “No”, be more specific
    - Don’t use things like “Oops”, “Sorry” and “Please” too much

- Create useful empty states
    - Give helpful hints, or party in an inbox for example
    - Use an appropriate tone
    - Make clear what user can do instead of being too playful

## Empathy

- Write for everyone
    - Speak to the audience, but don’t leave people out
    - Idioms or humor can be easily misunderstood

- Be responsive to localization
    - Consider that words can get longer, or need more vertical space
    - Space of text should be able to grow or adjust width
    - Also consider things like calendar day abbreviations

- Design for accessibility
    - Consider dynamic type settings, VoiceOver
    - Have thoughtful and descriptive text
    - Consider symbols & images as well
    - VoiceOver has descriptions for emojis
    - provide context and position
    - Be thoughtful to include everybody – e.g. “person” instead of woman
    - Last tip: Read your writing out loud (helps find repetitive words, how it sounds, naturality, etc.)
