- New size limit: Up to 15MB, uncompressed, thinned App Clip bundle (only when iOS 16 is minimum OS)
- New <kbd>Diagnostics</kbd> tool: 
  - go to <kbd>Settings.app > App Clips Testing > Diagnostics</kbd>
  - insert your app clips URL
  - the tool will check your URL's configuration and give you feedback if necessary

- CloudKit
  - New in iOS 16, App Clips can read data and resources stored in a CloudKit public database
  - To enable CloudKit, go to <kbd>Signing & Capabilities</kbd> of your App Clip target, and select the CloudKit container you want your App Clip to use
  - the public container can be a new one or one shared with the app
  - Still cannot write data to CloudKit
  - No private or shared database access
  - no Cloud documents or key-value store

- Keychain migration
  - Now your App Clip can simply store secure items in the keychain and they will be moved to your app when it's installed.
  - There's no longer need to migrate this data via a shared app group container
