## [Swift Async Algorithms][swift-async-algorithms] open-source package

- set of algorithms specifically focused on processing values over time using [`AsyncSequence`][asyncsequence]
- incorporates more advanced algorithms, as well as interoperating with clocks

## [`AsyncSequence`][asyncsequence]

- protocol that lets you describe values produced asynchronously
- just like `Sequence` but uses Swift concurrency (`next()` function from its iterator, `AsyncIterator`, is `async`)

### Multi-input algorithms

- algorithms that take multiple input `AsyncSequences` and produce one output `AsyncSequence`
- focused on combining `AsyncSequences` together in different ways

Examples: 

- [`zip(_:...)`][zip(_:...)] - creates an asynchronous sequence of pairs built out of underlying asynchronous sequences

```swift
for try await (vid, preview) in zip(videos, previews) {
  try await upload(vid, preview)
}
```

- [`merge(_:...)`][merge(_:...)] - merges two or more asynchronous sequence into a single asynchronous sequence producing the elements of all of the underlying asynchronous sequences (elements types must be the same)

```swift
for try await message in merge(primaryAccount.messages, secondaryAccount.messages) {
  displayPreview(message)
}
```

## Clock, Instant, and Duration 

- new API in Swift 5.7

### `Clock`

- Swift protocol, defines:
  - a way to wake up after a given instant
  - a way to produce a concept of "now"

Two built-in `Clock`s definitions are `ContinuousClock` and the `SuspendingClock`:

- use `ContinuousClock` to measure time just like a stopwatch, where time progresses no matter the state of the thing being measured
- `SuspendingClock`, on the other hand, suspends when the machine is put to sleep


```swift
// Sleep until a given deadline

let clock = SuspendingClock() 
var deadline = clock.now + .seconds(3)
try await clock.sleep(until: deadline) 
```

The key difference between these two clocks is that the `ContinuousClock` progresses while/when/if the machine is asleep.

Use `SuspendingClock` for:

- Measuring device time
- Delays for animation

Use `ContinuousClock` for:

- Measuring human time
- Delays by an absolute duration

### Swift Async Algorithms

- the package brings in a family of algorithms to work with time by leveraging these new Swift APIs

Examples:

- [`debounce(for:tolerance:clock:)`][debounce(for:tolerance:clock:)]

```swift
let queries = searchValues.debounce(for: .milliseconds(300))

for await query in queries {
  let results = try await performSearch(query)
  await channel.send(results)
}
```

- [`chunks(...)` and `chunked(...)`][chuck] - groups elements into collections by count/time/content

```swift
let batches = outboundMessages.chunked(
  by: .repeating(every: .milliseconds(500))
)

let encoder = JSONEncoder() 
for await batch in batches {
  let data = try encoder.encode(batch)
  try await postToServer(data) 
}
```

## Collections

- the package offers a set of initializers for constructing collections using `AsyncSequence` (array, set, dictionary)
