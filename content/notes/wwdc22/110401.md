## What is a package plugin?

- Xcode runs plugins, plugins can communicate back
- Can be used for custom build tasks
- Also custom commands to SwiftPM CLI can be added

## Custom commands

- First, create a new folder in package called `Plugins`
- Create another nested folder for plugin target, e.g. `GenerateContributors`
- Create a Swift file inside, e.g. `plugin.swift`
- Make sure to bump the package tools version to 5.6 (or higher)
- Insert `.plugin` in the `targets` in your package manifest file:
    
```swift
.plugin(
  name: "GenerateContributors",
  capability: .command(
    intent: .custom(
      verb: "regenerate-contributors-list",
      description: "Generates the CONTRIBUTORS.txt file based on Git logs"
    ),
    permissions: [
      .writeToPackageDirectory(reason: "This command write the new CONTRIBUTORS.txt to the source root.")
    ]
  )
),
```

- `intent` can define a verb for the SwiftPM command line for `command` capability plugins
- `permissions` is used if you need to write into a directory (Sandbox)
- Implement by `import PackagePlugin` and conforming to `CommandPlugin` protocol
- To shell out to other tools, `import Foundation` and then call `Process().executableURL` and `.arguments`
- Define a `Pipe` to read output so you can use it in your logic

```swift
import PackagePlugin
import Foundation

@main
struct GenerateContributors: CommandPlugin {

  func performCommand(
    context: PluginContext,
    arguments: [String]
  ) async throws {
    let process = Process()
    process.executableURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: "/usr/bin/git")
    process.arguments = ["log", "--pretty=format:- %an <%ae>%n"]

    let outputPipe = Pipe()
    process.standardOutput = outputPipe
    try process.run()
    process.waitUntilExit()

    let outputData = outputPipe.fileHandleForReading.readDataToEndOfFile()
    let output = String(decoding: outputData, as: UTF8.self)

    let contributors = Set(output.components(separatedBy: CharacterSet.newlines)).sorted().filter { !$0.isEmpty }
    try contributors.joined(separator: "\n").write(toFile: "CONTRIBUTORS.txt", atomically: true, encoding: .utf8)
  }
}
```
    
- New command available in right-click context-menu of package
- Xcode will ask for permission showing the text in `permissions` from manifest file

## Plugins in detail

- Package plugins run in a Sandbox, access to work directory only
- To wrap another tool, make sure it only writes in work directory
- Build Tool Plugins structure (similar to run script phases in Xcode)
  - Executables
  - Inputs
  - Outputs

- Types of Build Tool Plugins
  - In-build command (if you have a clear set of outputs)
  - Pre-build command (if no clear outputs, but make sure to be performant!)

## In-build commands

- Plugins get run at the start of the build process
- Use `ProcessInfo().arguments` to read arguments in your own tool
- To create an executable, create new folder in `Sources`
    - Then add a `main.swift` file
    - Declare it in the `Package.manifest`

- Put the tool target into the `dependencies` of your plugin to use it
- Extend `BuildToolPlugin` instead of `CommandPlugin`

## Pre-build commands

- To make a plugin available to clients of a package, add it to `products` in `Package.swift` manifest file
