## ARKit-enhanced Nearby Interaction 

- leverages the same underlying technology that powers Precision Finding with AirTag
- available via Nearby Interaction
- distance and direction information is more consistently available than using Nearby Interaction alone
- best for use cases that need to guide a user to a specific nearby object
- best used for interacting with stationary devices
- Requires `NSCameraUsageDescription` purpose string in <kbd>Info.plist</kbd>

Enable this via the new [`NINearbyPeerConfiguration`][NINearbyPeerConfiguration]'s [`isCameraAssistanceEnabled`][isCameraAssistanceEnabled] property

```swift
let session = NISession()

let configuration = NINearbyPeerConfiguration(..)
configuration.isCameraAssistanceEnabled = true // 👈🏻

session.run(configuration)
```

⚠️ Only a single `ARSession` can be running for a given application.

If you already have an ARKit experience in your app, it is necessary to share that `ARSession` with the `NISession`:

```swift
let niSession = NISession()

let arView = ARView(frame: .zero)
niSession.setARSesion(arView.session) // 👈🏻
```

## Background sessions

Until now, when the app transitions to the background, or when the user locks the screen on iOS and watchOS, any running `NISession`s are suspended until the application returns to the foreground.

In iOS 16, we can connect to devices via BLE and then run a NISession in the background:

```swift
var niSession = NISession()

func runBackgroundSession(accessoryData: Data, peripheral: CBPeripheral) {
  // Provide the accessory's UWB configuration data, and its Bluetooth peer identifier
  let peerIdentifier = peripheral.identifier
  let config = NINearbyAccessoryConfiguration(
    accessoryData: accessoryData,
    bluetoothPeerIdentifier: peerIdentifier
  )
  session.run(config)
}
```

This helps create "hands-free" experiences, like having music start playing as soon as the user walks into a room.

This background mode requires the `Nearby Interaction` string in the `UIBackgroundModes` array in your app's <kbd>Info.plist</kbd>

## Third-party hardware

- U1-compatible development kits out of beta
- Updated specification for accessory manufacturers
