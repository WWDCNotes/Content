## Deprecation notice

All previous navigation APIs are deprecated:

- `NavigationView` is replaced by two new _containers_, [`NavigationStack`][NavigationStack] and [`NavigationSplitView`][NavigationSplitView] (more on this later)
- `NavigationLink` still exists, has a completely different API and behavior, and is no longer mandatory to use

## New navigation APIs

### Containers

- with the new containers, we have a single binding for managing their stack state/path
- this single binding represents all the values pushed onto the stack, think of it as an array of screens
  - The new `NavigationLink` APIs append values to this binding
  - you can directly mutate this binding yourself (just add/remove elements from this state/path array)
  - You can programmatically push/pop multiple screens at once
  - You can programmatically deep link
  - You can pop to the root view by removing all the items

Two new containers:

1. [`NavigationStack`][NavigationStack] - for a single push-pop stack
2. [`NavigationSplitView`][NavigationSplitView] - for multi-column apps
  - automatically adapts into a single-column stack on iPhone, into Slide Over on iPad, Apple Watch and Apple TV
  - provides configuration options that let you:
    - customize column widths (see [`navigationSplitViewColumnWidth(_:)`][navigationSplitViewColumnWidth(_:)] and similar modifiers)
    - control sidebar presentation and show/hide columns (see [`NavigationSplitViewVisibility`][navigationsplitviewvisibility] and associated modifiers)

`NavigationSplitView` has two initializers:

- To create a two-column navigation split view, use [`init(sidebar:detail:)`][init(sidebar:detail:)]
- To create a three-column view, use the [`init(sidebar:content:detail:)`][init(sidebar:content:detail:)]

```swift
NavigationStack(path: $path) {
  NavigationLink("trigger", value: value)
}

NavigationSplitView {
  List(model.employees, selection: $employeeIds) { employee in
    Text(employee.name)	
  }
} detail: {
  EmployeeDetails(for: employeeIds)
}
```

### NavigationLink

- appends elements onto the stack it appears in
- no longer accepts a `destination` parameter (we use the new [`navigationDestination(for:destination:)`][navigationDestination(for:destination:)] modifier instead)
- is no longer needed, programmatically append things to the `$path` state yourself instead

### [`navigationDestination(for:destination:)`][navigationDestination(for:destination:)] modifier

- declares the type of the presented data that it's responsible for
- takes in a view builder that describes what view to push onto the stack when a instance of that data is presented

```swift
NavigationStack {
  List {
    NavigationLink("Mint", value: Color.mint)
    NavigationLink("Pink", value: Color.pink)
    NavigationLink("Teal", value: Color.teal)
  }
  .navigationDestination(for: Color.self) { color in
    ColorDetail(color: color) // The view to be pushed
  }
  .navigationTitle("Colors")
}
```

> Explanation: when a navigation link is tapped, a new `Color` value is appended to the `NavigationStack` internal `$path` state, `NavigationStack` then asks the `navigationDestination(for:destination:)` modifier associated with `Color` for the view to be pushed.

- Every navigation stack keeps track of a path that represents all the data that the stack is showing
- When the stack shows its root view, the path is empty
- the stack also keeps track of all the navigation destinations declared inside it, or inside any view pushed onto the stack
- if you'd like to use this path yourself (e.g., for programmatic navigation), use the new type-erasing [`NavigationPath`][NavigationPath] collection where you can push values of different types

Example with explicit path:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
  /// The stack state.
  @State private var path: [Int] = []

  var body: some View {
    // This navigation doesn't use NavigationLink! 🎉
    NavigationStack(path: $path) {
      NumberView(0, onGoToNextNumber: { path = [1] })
        // 👇🏻 This modifier returns the view to be pushed for $path values of type Int
        .navigationDestination(for: Int.self) { number in 
          NumberView(number, onGoToNextNumber: { path.append(number + 1) })
        }
    }
  }
}

/// A view that displays a number and has a button triggering an action injected by 
/// its parent view.
struct NumberView: View {
  var number: Int
  var onGoToNextNumber: () -> Void

  init(_ number: Int, onGoToNextNumber: @escaping () -> Void) {
    self.number = number
    self.onGoToNextNumber = onGoToNextNumber
  }

  var body: some View {
    Text("\(number)").font(.headline)
    Button("Go to next number", action: onGoToNextNumber)
  }
}
```

## Persistent state

1. encapsulate your navigation state into a `Codable` model
2. use `SceneStorage` to save and restore that state
3. restore data via `.task`:

```swift
// Use SceneStorage to save and restore
@StateObject private var navModel = NavigationModel()
@SceneStorage("navigation") private var data: Data?

var body: some View {
  NavigationSplitView { ... }
  .task {
  	// restore state if present
  	if let data = data {
  		navModel.jsonData = data
    }

    // start an asynchronous for loop that will iterate 
    // whenever my navigation model changes. The body of 
    // this loop will run on each change, so I can use 
    // that to save my navigation state back to my scene 
    // storage data.
    for await _ in navModel.objectWillChangeSequence {
    	data = navModel.jsonData
    }
  }
}
```

## Tips

- Check Apple's [Migrating to New Navigation Types][migrating-to-new-navigation-types] article
- `List`, `NavigationSplitView`, and `NavigationStack` were made to mix together
- put `navigationDestination(for:destination:)` modifiers within easy reach
- start with `NavigationSplitView` when it makes sense
