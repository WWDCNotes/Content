## What is a package plugin?

- Swift script that can be run as part of your build
- A package could have plugins as extra, or be all about plugins
- Package plugins are available only within package
- General plugins can be made available to the outside
- Lets you access development tools on your machine

### Command plugins:

- implement custom actions, such as formatters, linters, prepare distribution
- can ask for permission to modify files in package
- some might just read to report some data

### Build tool plugins:

- extend the dependency graph
- applied to each target that needs them

## Demo

- add plugin like any other package dependency in project, via the `dependencies` in your package manifest file:
    
```swift
let package = Package (
  name: "CoreLib",
  products: [
    .library(name:"CoreLib", targets: ["CoreLib"])
  ],
  dependencies: [
    // 👇🏻
    .package (url: "git@example.com:DemoPackages/SourceCodeUtilityPlugins.git", branch: "main")
  ],
  targets: [
    .target (name: "CoreLib"),
    .testTarget(name: "CoreLibTests", dependencies: ["CoreLib"])
  ]
)
```

- the plugin will be available once downloaded (no need to add it as a dependency on target or similar)
- When running plugins, you choose the target and can pass extra arguments
- Xcode asks permission for plugins that modify your files, has a <kbd>show code</kbd> button

## How do plugins work?

- plugins can create files, read dependencies
- plugins run in a Sandbox
- plugin can send results back to Xcode, such as warnings and errors
- use `import PackagePlugin` to implement one
    
```swift
import PackagePlugin

@main
struct MyPlugin: ... {

    // Entry points specific to plugin capability. These entry points are invoked
    // when the plugin is applied to a package.

}

// 👇🏻 use #if canImport for conditional support for Xcode projects
#if canImport(XcodeProjectPlugin)
import XcodeProjectPlugin

extension MyPlugin: ... {

  // Entry points specific to plugin capability. These entry points are invoked
  // when the plugin is applied to an Xcode project.

}
#endif
```

Two plugin types:

- Command plugins
- Build tool plugins

## Command plugins

- implement development-time actions
- Run interactively, not during a build (e.g., manually triggered by the developer)
- Must ask for permission to modify package sources
- Might depend on other tools to do the actual work
- dependencies on tools plugins can be both binaries or source code
- run `swift package plugin --list` to see which plugins are available
- run `swift package <plugin_name>` to run them in current directory
- run with `swift package --allow-writing-to-package-directory <plugin_name>` to give write access
- append `--verbose` to see more output from plugin

## Build tool plugins

- provide commands for the build system, triggered at build time (not manually)
- can invoke executable provided as binaries or built from source
- supports build commands and prebuild commands
- output files are stored with other build artifacts, not among your package source code
- commands run in a sandbox to prevent changes in package
- Requires conforming to `BuildToolPlugin` protocol, return type is `[Command]`
    
```swift
import PackagePlugin

@main
struct MyPlugin: BuildToolPlugin {

  /// This entry point is called when operating on a Swift package.
  func createBuildCommands(context: PluginContext, target: Target) throws -> [Command]
    debugPrint(context)
    return []
  }
}

// 👇🏻 use #if canImport for conditional support for Xcode projects
#if canImport(XcodeProjectPlugin)
import XcodeProjectPlugin

extension MyPlugin: XcodeBuildToolPlugin {

  /// This entry point is called when operating on an Xcode project.
  func createBuildCommands(context: XcodePluginContext, target: XcodeTarget) throws -> [Command]
    debugPrint(context)
    return []
  }
}
#endif
```
    
- Build commands run as part of the build
  - You specify input and output paths
  - They run only when their output is missing, or when their inputs (e.g. files, assets) has changed (they're skipped otherwise)

- Prebuild commands run before the build starts
- Add plugins to targets via `plugins` parameter
    
```swift
let package = Package (
  name: "CoreLib",
  products: [
    .library(name:"CoreLib", targets: ["CoreLib"])
  ],
  dependencies: [
    // 👇🏻
    .package (url: "git@example.com:DemoPackages/MySourceGenPlugin.git", from: "1.0.0")
  ],
  targets: [
    .target (
      name: "CoreLib",
      plugins: [
        .plugin(name: "MySourceGenBuildTool", package: "MySourceGenPlugin") // 👈🏻 required!
      ]
    ),
    .testTarget(name: "CoreLibTests", dependencies: ["CoreLib"])
  ]
)
```
