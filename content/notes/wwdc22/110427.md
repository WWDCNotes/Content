- Xcode 14 is 30% smaller, you must manually download additional platforms/simulators

## Preview canvas

- Interactive Previews (no need to click “Play” button anymore)
- Easy to see multiple dynamic type sizes using the 3rd icon on the bottom left
- First button in bottom left brings back to single view

## New features

- Xcode library now includes all of the SF Symbols
- Parameters with default value are now italic in auto-completion
- Auto-completion of just the arguments you need via fuzzy search
- You can now see all call-sites of a method via command-click
- Compiler checks Regex literals and shows errors at compile-time
- build errors are dimmed to gray when Xcode is reevaluating the diagnostics
  - for example after we change the code where the previous build had an error
  - this helps especially on long builds, where we can now easily tell which problems are from the latest build and which are from a previous build
- The new multiplatform target creates a single SwiftUI interface for use across iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and tvOS
- While you scroll, code structure (like function declarations) stays visible so you always know where you are
- When browsing a long file definition, the current type and function are sticky at the top of the window
- Interface Builder speeds-up:
  - 50% faster loading docs
  - 30% faster switching devices

## Build improvements

- Improved parallelism by eagerly producing Swift modules
- Linking 2x faster (via increased parallelism)
- Overall, Xcode is 25% faster in building
- Xcode 14 has a new build timeline to visualize build times:

## Parallel testing improvements

- Xcode 14 eliminates scheduling dependencies between targets and test classes to increase parallelism
- up to 30% faster Tests for large test projects

## Ease of use improvements

- 4x faster notarization
- Xcode 14 supports a single target with multiple target destinations
- Xcode 14 expands memory object graph capabilities so that you can see all reference paths in and out of an object
- You can extend Xcode with Swift Package plugins

2. Hangs
  - shows the highest-impact hangs from App Store users so that you know which code to restructure to have the biggest impact
