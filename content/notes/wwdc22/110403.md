## Background Assets

- new framework called [Background Assets][ba]
- aims to:
  - reduce app download size from App Store
  - avoid having launch screen where apps need to download even more assets (make sure that assets are present before first app launch, or whenever the app is updated overnight)

- supports out-of-band content (able to push updated content to your apps without submission to the App Store)

- achieved via a new app extension for downloading content in the background
  - execution outside of an app's lifecycle
  - extension runtime is short-lived, schedule your downloads quickly
  - extension will execute:
    - after app installation (via AppStore or Test Flight)
    - after an app update
    - periodically in the background (based on app usage)

## Adopting the framework

### Download manager

- [`BADownloadManager`][BADownloadManager]
- primary way to communicate with the Background Assets system service (for managing assets)
- singleton object
- can be used throughout your app
- use it to: 
  - schedule downloads (in either foreground or background)
  - retrieve current download operations
  - cancel downloads
  - synchronize between app and app extension

#### Start downloading assets

```swift
// Getting started with Background Assets
import BackgroundAssets

let url = URL(string: "https://cdn.example.com/large-asset.bin")!

// 👇🏻 Use this app group container to manage your assets between app and the extension
let appGroupIdentifier = "group.WWDC.AssetContainer"

// 👇🏻 This is your download object, BackgroundAssets offers different objects.
//    This object tells the system both what we're downloading and where the 
//    resulting file will end up.
let download = BAURLDownload(
  identifier: "Large-Asset", // 👈🏻 Use this id to track the asset download across app/extensions launches
  request: URLRequest(url: url),
  applicationGroupIdentifier:
  appGroupIdentifier
)

// 👇🏻 Schedule the download via BADownloadManager
let manager = BADownloadManager.shared
manager.delegate = self // BADownloadManagerDelegate protocol
//       👆🏻 gets notified as soon as download objects are processed by the system

// Schedule download at an opportunistic time determined by the system
do {
  try manager.schedule(download)
} catch {
  print("Failed to schedule download. \(error)")
}

// or Schedule download in foreground
// This allows download to begin immediately (possible only in the app, not in the extension)
do {
  try manager.startForegroundDownload(download)
} catch {
  print("Failed to start foreground download. \(error)")
}

// or Promote downloads to foreground.
do {
  for download in try await manager.fetchCurrentDownloads) {
     try manager.startForegroundDownload(download)
  }
} catch {
  print("Failed to promote downloads to foreground \(error)")
}
```

- [`BADownloadManagerDelegate`][BADownloadManagerDelegate]
  - receives callbacks for all downloads that have been scheduled by either the extension or your app
  - if your app does not handle one of the delegate methods or your delegate is not set, then your extension will wake to process the callback
  - the extension (if the app doesn't handle such methods) is woken only for callbacks that share common interfaces between `BADownloadManagerDelegate` and the [`BADownloaderExtension`][BADownloaderExtension] protocol

```swift
public protocol BADownloadManagerDelegate : NSObjectProtocol {

  /// triggered whenever a download starts
  optional func downloadDidBegin(_ download: BADownload)

  /// triggered whenever a download pauses
  optional func downloadDidPause(_ download: BADownload)

  /// lets you monitor active progress of your download as it is being downloaded in the foreground
  optional func download(
    _ download: BADownload, 
    bytesWritten: Int64, 
    totalBytesWritten: Int64, 
    totalExpectedBytes: Int64
  )

  /// lets you answer a challenge request. Useful for validating the authenticity of a connection 
  /// or for providing credentials to authorize a connection.
  optional func download(
    _ download: BADownload, 
    didReceive challenge: URLAuthenticationChallenge
  ) async -> (URLSession.AuthChallengeDisposition, URLCredential?)

  /// triggered whenever a download fails
  ///
  /// You might want to re-schedule the download, or figure out the failure cause
  optional func download(_ download: BADownload, failedWithError error: Error)

  /// triggered whenever a download completes
  ///
  /// Apple recommends to leave the file at the given URL, so that it can be managed by the 
  /// system (a.k.a. the system will delete the file "for you" if the device is low on space)
  optional func download(_ download: BADownload, finishedWithFileURL fileURL: URL)
}
```

## Extension overview

### Requirements

Required app <kbd>Info.plist</kbd> configurations (note: only the app <kbd>Info.plist</kbd> needs this, not the extension):

1. set a [<kbd>BAInitialDownloadRestrictions</kbd>][bainitialdownloadrestrictions] dictionary, which declares two restrictions for your extension:
  - [<kbd>BADownloadAllowance</kbd>][BADownloadAllowance] (Integer) - declare the combined size (in Bytes) of the initial set of asset downloads
  - [<kbd>BADownloadDomainAllowList</kbd>][BADownloadDomainAllowList] (Array of strings) - list of web domains the extension can use when scheduling the initial set of asset downloads (prefix wildcards are permitted, e.g., `*.cdn.example.com`)

2. set a [<kbd>BAMaxInstallSize</kbd>][BAMaxInstallSize] Number, representing the maximum size that your app will require in additional storage for these assets (when uncompressed)

- <kbd>BAInitialDownloadRestrictions</kbd> are reviewed by App Review, try to be as accurate as possible
- <kbd>BAInitialDownloadRestrictions</kbd> are only enforced after first app install, whenever your app is launched, these restrictions are no longer enforced
- <kbd>BAMaxInstallSize</kbd> is shown in the App Store

### Extension entry points

- the functions that you define from the [`BADownloaderExtension`][BADownloaderExtension] protocol will be called by the system and not by your app
- keep work at a minimum: the extension is for quick scheduling only, do not do anything like assets decompression or similar
- the extension has access to [`BADownloadManager`][BADownloadManager]
- use an app group container to manage your assets between app and the extension

```swift
public protocol BADownloaderExtension: NSObjectProtocol {
  // Triggered when the app is first installed - the app has not launched yet, but your extension has.
  // Use this callback to download required assets not present in your app binary
  // (remember: this is where info.plist download restrictions above are applied)
  optional func applicationDidInstall(metadata: BAApplicationExtensionInfo)

  // Triggered when the app gets updated (a new version has been published on the store
  // and it has been downloaded into the device).
  // As long as the user hasn't quit your app in the app switcher, this will trigger.
  optional func applicationDidUpdate(metadata: BAApplicationExtensionInfo)

  /// Periodically awoken by the system, use this to check for any updates that need to be background downloaded
  optional func checkForUpdates(metadata: BAApplicationExtensionInfo)

  /// Like BADownloadManagerDelegate
  optional func download(_ download: BADownload, didReceive challenge: URLAuthenticationChallenge) async -> (URLSession.AuthChallengeDisposition, URLCredential?)

  /// Like BADownloadManagerDelegate
  optional func backgroundDownloadDidFail(failedDownload: BADownload)

  /// Like BADownloadManagerDelegate, the error is stored within the BADownload object
  optional func backgroundDownloadDidFinish(finishedDownload: BADownload, fileURL: URL)
  
  optional func extensionWillTerminate()
}
```

### Synchronizing app and extension

- If both app and extensions are running, and both have set their own `BADownloadManager.shared.delegate`, both will received events regarding download finished and similar callbacks
- to avoid data races (e.g., where both app and extension would try to react on a download completed event), use `BADownloadManager`'s [`withExclusiveControl(_:)`][withExclusiveControl(_:)] or [`withExclusiveControl(beforeDate:_:)`][withExclusiveControl(beforeDate:_:)]
  - these methods accept a closure which guarantees to be mutually exclusive with other calls that require exclusive control
  - note that acquiring exclusive control can fail, check for the `error` parameter passed to your closure

```swift
// Synchronizing between app and extension
func download(_ download: BADownload, finishedWithFileURL fileURL: URL) {
  let manager = BADownloadManager.shared

  manager.withExclusiveControl { error in
    guard error == nil else {
      print("Unable to acquire exclusive control \(String(describing: error))")
      return
    }
    // Exclusive control acquired
    // All code in this scope ensures mutual exclusion between extension and app
    do {
      let data = try Data(contentsOf: fileURL, options: .mappedIfSafe)
      // Do something with memory mapped data
      try FileManager.default.removeItem(at: fileURL)
    } catch {
      print("Unable to read/cleanup file data. \(error)")
    }
  }
}
