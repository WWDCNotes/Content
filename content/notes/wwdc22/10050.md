## Complication history

- Complications present quick, glanceable information on the watch face
- in watchOS 2, [ClockKit][cc] enabled you to create your own complications
- in watchOS 5, rich complications were introduced, with graphic colorful content
- in watchOS 7, SwiftUI complications and multiple complications were introduced
- in watchOS 9, complications have been re-imagined and remade with [WidgetKit][wk], embracing SwiftUI and bringing the glanceable complication experience to iOS in the form of widgets

![][watch-vs-lockscreen]

### New [`WidgetFamily`][WidgetFamily] families
- `accessoryCircular`
  - A circular widget
  - great for brief information, gauges, and progress views
  - replaces [ClockKit's graphicCircular][clkcomplicationfamily/graphiccircular] family

- `accessoryCorner`
  - watchOS only
  - complication in the corner of a watch face in watchOS

- `accessoryRectangular`
  - A rectangular widget
  - can be used to show multiple lines of text or small graphs and charts
  - replaces [ClockKit graphicRectangular][CLKComplicationFamily.graphicRectangular] family

- `accessoryInline`
  - A flat widget that contains a single row of text and an optional image
  - present on many faces on watchOS and above the time on iOS LockScreen

## Colors

![The three new rendering modes][rendering-modes]

- the system controls the look of accessory family widgets
- three different rendering modes your widget might be shown in (refer to image above):
  - full color
  - accented
  - vibrant

This is exposed via a new `widgetRenderingMode` environment variable of type [`WidgetRenderingMode`][widgetrenderingmode]:

```swift
struct MyWidgetView: View {
  @Environment(\.widgetRenderingMode) var widgetRenderingMode // 👈🏻

  var body: some View {
    ...
  }
}
```

### Full color mode

- content is displayed exactly as specified

### Accented mode

- your views are split into two groups and colored independently
- the two coloring groups are flatly colored, preserving only their original opacities
- you can tell the system how to group your views with the [`.widgetAccentable(_:)`][widgetaccentable(_:)] view modifier
- ...or switch out your content based on the Widget Rendering Mode environment value to look perfect when flattened

```swift
VStack(alignment: .leading) {
  Text("Headline")
    .font(.headline)
    .widgetAccentable() // 👈🏻
  Text("Body 1")
  Text("Body 2")
}.frame(maxWidth: .infinity, alignment: .leading)
```

- Note that the system can tint your content in a number of ways, some of which are inverted

![][tints]

### Vibrant mode  

- your views are desaturated then colored appropriately for the Lock Screen background
- the system maps your greyscale content in to a material appearance
- a light source color ends up mostly opaque and brighter
- a dark source color appears as a less prominent blur of the background behind it, with only a slight amount of brightening
- avoid using transparent colors in this mode, instead, use darker colors or black to represent less prominent content while maintaining legibility

### [`AccessoryWidgetBackground`][AccessoryWidgetBackground]

New [`AccessoryWidgetBackground`][AccessoryWidgetBackground] view, to give a consistent backdrop to widgets that need them:

- takes on different appearances in the various widget rendering modes
- tuned by the system to look right for the style of the face or Lock Screen
- soft transparent view in full color and accented
- black in vibrant mode, which results in a low brightness and full blur

```swift
ZStack {
   AccessoryWidgetBackground() // 👈🏻
   VStack {
    Text("MON")
    Text("6")
     .font(.title)
  }
}
```
