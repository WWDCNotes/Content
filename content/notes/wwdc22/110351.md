## Task isolation

- Task isolation ensures that data across tasks is not shared in a manner that can introduce data races

### Task

- A task performs a specific job sequentially from start to finish
- Tasks are asynchronous, and their work can be suspended any number of times at `await` operations
- A task is self-contained - has its own resources and can operate by itself, independently of any other task

### Communications between tasks

- done by passing objects across tasks (a task passes an object by returning a value at the end of its body)
- no problem if the shared/transferred data is value type
- can (potentially) cause data races if the data is reference type

#### Sendable

Swift helps us telling us when it's safe to share our data across tasks via the `Sendable` protocol:

- `Sendable` descibes types that can cross an isolation domain (like tasks), without making data races 
- data races checks happen while building by the Swift compiler
- For tasks, the actual `Sendable` constraint comes from their definition: `Task`s return type must conform to `Sendable`
- You should use `Sendable` constraints where you have generic parameters whose values will be passed across different isolation domains
- `Sendable` conformances can be inferred by the Swift compiler for non-public types (but you can add `Sendable` conformance explicitly)
- Classes (reference types) can conform to `Sendable` only under very narrow circumstances
  - e.g., when a `final` class only has immutable storage

- for reference types that do their own internal synchronization (e.g., via locks), you can use `@unchecked Sendable`

```swift
class ConcurrentCache<Key: Hashable & Sendable, Value: Sendable>: @unchecked Sendable {
  var lock: NSLock
  var storage: [Key: Value]

  // ...
}
```

## Actor isolation

- `Actor`s provide a way to isolate state that can be accessed by different tasks, in a coordinated manner that eliminates data races
- an `Actor` is self-contained - has its own resources and can operate by itself, independently of any other Actor
- in order to execute code (or read values) defined in an actor, you need to use a task
- only one task can execute on an actor at a time
- entering into an actor is a potential suspension point, as there might be already another task running on it, and even other tasks waiting to enter into that specific actor 
- the same rules for communications across tasks are true for communication between tasks and actors and between actors
  - said in other words, actors rely on `Sendable`, too

- `Actor`s are reference types, but isolate all of their properties and code to prevent concurrent access
  - all `Actor` types are implicitly `Sendable`

- all Actor instance definitions (properties and functions) are isolated
  - a child/sub task inherits all attributes of the parent task, therefore, if a task is generated directly by an actor function, said task inherits actor isolation from its context (thus will be able to access the actor properties and call other functions without `await`ing on them
  - the same is not true for detached tasks, which do not inherit traits from that task’s originating context
  - Actor properties and functions marked as `nonisolated` are considered to be outside the actor

### @MainActor

- represents main thread
- use it when you need to update UI in your app
- use the `@MainActor` attribute to indicate that the code must run on the main actor:

```swift
@MainActor func updateView() { … }

Task { @MainActor in
  // update UI here
}
```

- the Swift compiler will guarantee that main-actor-isolated code will only be executed on the main thread

- `@MainActor` can also be applied to types, in which case the instances of those types will be isolated to the main actor
  - properties will be only accessible while on the main actor
  - methods are isolated to the main actor, unless marked `nonisolated`

```swift
@MainActor
class ChickenValley: Sendable {
  var flock: [Chicken]
  var food: [Pineapple]

  func advanceTime() {
    for chicken in flock {
      chicken.eat(from: &food)
    }
  }
}
```

## Atomicity

- state can change across `awaits` calls
- if you're not careful, you can end up with a high-level data race where the program is in an unexpected state, even though the data is not corrupted
- when writing your actor, think in terms of synchronous, transactional operations that can be interleaved in any way
- keep async actor operations simple

## Ordering

- Swift Concurrency provides tools for ordering operations
- actors do no guaranteed FIFO processing
- actors execute the highest-priority work first
  - eliminates priority inversions
  - diffent than serial Dispatch queues, which execute in a strictly FIFO order

Tools for ordering:

- `Task`s
- `AsyncStream`s deliver elements in order:

```swift
for await event in eventStream {
  await process(event)
}
```
