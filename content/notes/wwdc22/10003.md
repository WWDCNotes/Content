## Requesting weather

Two ways:

- [WeatherKit][wk]
- [WeatherKit REST API][api]

### WeatherKit

```swift
import WeatherKit
import CoreLocation

let weatherService = WeatherService()
let location = CLLocation(latitude: 43, longitude: -76)
let weather = try! await weatherService.weather(for: location)
let temperature = weather.currentWeather.temperature
let uvIndex = weather.currentWeather.uvIndex
```

### WeatherKit REST API

```js
/* Request a token */
const tokenResponse = await fetch('https://example.com/token');
const token = await tokenResponse.text();

/* Get my weather object */
const url = "https://weatherkit.apple.com/1/weather/en-US/41.029/-74.642?dataSets=weatherAlerts&country=US"

const weatherResponse = await fetch(url, {
  headers: {
    "Authorization": token
  }
});
const weather = await weatherResponse.json();

/* Check for active weather alerts */
const alerts = weather.weatherAlerts;
const detailsUrl = weather.weatherAlerts.detailsUrl;
```
## Publishing requirements

1. attribution: you must display a link that is retrieved from the Attribution APIs
2. attribution logo: you must display the Apple Weather logo, given both by WeatherKit and the rest API
3. if you show weather alters: you must link to a Weather alert page included in the response
