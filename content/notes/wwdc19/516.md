## Sign in with Apple

- Private alternative to 3rd party logins
- Authentication via Face ID / Touch ID (2-factor built-in)
- Verifying email addresses is already done by Apple (Apple ID)
- Claimed to be easier than passwords
- Across platforms
  - iOS 13+
  - iPadOS 13+
  - watchOS 6+
  - macOS 10.15+
  - tvOS 13+
  - Safari 13+
  - Other platforms via JavaScript (Windows, Android and other browsers)

- On app launch, app can check for existing password-based user accounts via Keychain

## Password-based Authentication

- Password Auto-fill available for iPad apps on the Mac
  - New app ID has to be listed on the server via apple-app-site-association file
  - New keys for Universal Links

- Authentication services can be used for apps (check associated domains to combine app and website)
- Can request multiple types of accounts via [`ASAuthorizationController`][ASAuthorizationController] (e.g. password-based + Sign in with Apple)

## Warnings for weak passwords

- iPhone + Mac have Automatic Strong Passwords
- Safari 13 on iOS 13 shows weak passwords + possibility to change it
  - Forwarding to website where user can change password
  - Redirect to https://example.com/.well-known/change-password (client-side or server-side)
  - [`Well-Known URL for Changing Passwords`][well-known-url]
  
## OAuth sign-in
  
- Available on iOS, and now macOS
  - macOS uses preferred web browser
  - If available, browser's password manager or password manager extension will help

- OAuth with ASWebAuthenticationSession
  - More private sign-in and better UX
    - No alert anymore but redirect to identify provider native UI
    - Set [`prefersEphemeralWebBrowserSession`][prefersEphemeralWebBrowserSession] = `true`

- 
  - Supporting multiple windows due to iPadOS and macOS support
  - Migrate from `SFAuthenticationSession` to [`ASWebAuthenticationSession`][ASWebAuthenticationSession]
  
## USB security keys on macOS

- Safari 13 supports USB-based FIDO2-compliant devices with the WebAuthentication standard
- Offer great account recovery story, like using previous mentioned services
