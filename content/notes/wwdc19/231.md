We can host SwiftUI content in your UIKit views via a [`UIHostingController`][HostDoc].

## Representable Protocol

- Lets us embed `UIView`s in SwiftUI views (via [`UIViewRepresentable`][viewRepDoc])
- Lets us embed child `ViewController`s (via [`UIViewControllerRepresentable`][vcRepDoc])

The protocol has three methods:

- `Make`: where we create the view or view controller that we want to present in SwiftUI.
- `Update`: where we update this view/ or view controller to the current configuration.
- `Dismantle`: optional.

During initialization, the `make` method is called first, followed by the `update` method.

The `update` method can be called multiple times, whenever an update is requested by SwiftUI.

## Representable Context

Used for advanced integration: perhaps we want to expose target action or delegation in SwiftUI, or we may want to read from the environment of SwiftUI and respond accordingly.

### [`Coordinator`][cooDoc]

- Helps with coordinating between UIVIew/Controller and SwiftUI
- Can be used to implement common patterns, like delegation, data sources, and target action.

### `Environment`

- Helps read SwiftUI environment 

### `Transaction`

- Lets our view know if there was an animation in SwiftUI.

## Item Providers

- Item providers are a great technology that's provided by `Foundation`, which provides us a means of moving data around your application in various forms.
- It's also a tool that we use to help transfer data across processes.
- We can use them to integrate with system services like drag and drop (by using [`.onDrag`][dragDoc] and [`.onDrop`][dropDoc]), pasteboard (via [`.onPasteCommand`][pasteDoc])
