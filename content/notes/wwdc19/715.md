With iOS 13 any iPhone from the iPhone 7 lineup and later can both read and write NDEF NFC Tags (**N**FC **D**ata **E**xchange **F**ormat).

We need to declare in the entitlements which tags we want to be able to read (basically a prefix of the tag identifier).

To write NDEF tags, we use the [`NFCNDEFReaderSession`][ndefDocs] and, after detecting the tag, we can read/write/lock it:

The sessions come with sample code to [read][read] and [write][write] NFC tags.
