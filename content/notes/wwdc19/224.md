- **Deprecation of LaunchImages** use Launch Storyboards instead
- **New App Store Requirement** Any app linking to iOS 13 must ensure correct layout at any size 
- **Split Screen Multitasking** is strongly recommended for iPad Apps
  - Apple is going to expect that **most** of the applications, **unless** you want to provide a truly immersive experience, are going to support split screen multitasking

- **UINavigationBarAppearance** customize `.standardAppearance` (iPhone portrait), `.compactAppearance` (iPhone landscape), `.scrollEdgeAppearance` (if attached to scrollView and scrolled to top, bar uses this one)
  - settable per `navigationItem` so customization per view controller possible (including color, transparency, …)

```swift
let appearance = navigationBar.standardAppearance.copy()
/* configuration */
navigationItem.standardAppearance = appearance
```

- **UIBarButtonAppearance, UIToolBarAppearance**
- **UITabBarAppearance** customize `.stackedLayoutAppearance` (text below icon), `.inlineLayoutAppearance` (text right to icon; iPads), `.compactInlineLayoutAppearance` (text right to icon; landscape; smaller phones)
- **UIModalPresentationStyle.[automatic | formSheet | pageSheet]** are able to stack behind each other
  - `.automatic` is the new default; gets resolved at presentation time
  - get the old behavior by `viewController.modalPresentationStyle = .fullScreen`
  - sheets get gesture recognizer added automatically to support `pull-to-dismiss` - opt-out possible (see link in description for example project)
  - **Appearance Callbacks Not Called for .PageSheet and .FormSheet** on presentingViewController:
    `viewWillAppear`, `viewDisappear`, `viewWillDisappear`, `viewDidDisappear`

- **Search UI** 
  - offers possibility to hide cancel button and scope control
  - expose `UISearchTextField` on `UISearchBar` so customization becomes possible
  - `Search Tokens` that represent complex searches
    - are copy&pastable and support drag&drop
    - can be created by user/developer from selected text in UISearchTextField

- **UITextInteraction** the new & easy way to control selection UI
- **Multi Selection in Table-/Collection Views** simply by Two-Finger-Swipe 
  - opt-in by implementing only 1 new delegate method for Tables and Collections

- **New Editing Gestures**
  - `pinch 3 fingers in`: copy selected text
  - `pinch 3 fingers out` paste copied text
  - `3 finger tap || 3 finger swipe back` undo
  - `3 finger swipe forward` redo
  - opt out by `responder.editingInteractionConfiguration = .none`

- **UIContextMenuInteraction** context menus with `rich preview`, `nested menus`, `in-line sections`
  - transform to context menus on macOS
  - `UIMenu` & `UIInteraction` provide hierarchical menu construction system
  - adopt by `view.addInteraction(UIContextMenuInteraction(delegate: self))`
  - customize how  view and menu will be presented: `UITargetedPreview & UITargetedDragPreview`
  - convenience delegate methods for context menus on UITableView & UICollectionView
  - `UIViewControllerPreviewing` (peek & pop) is deprecated for sake of this new API
  - replace long-press driven behavior/menus by this new API
