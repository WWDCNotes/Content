- Shortcuts can be used via `Suggestions` (at the right time), `Voice` (to use any capabilities of your app just by asking Siri) and `Multi Step Shortcuts` (by composing multiple shortcuts in a new one)
- Support for conversational shortcuts which lets users customize your Shortcut behavior
- Shortcuts app redesigned and build in to iOS
  - Adds `Automation` tab which lets users run shortcuts on certain conditions (Sunset, NFC-Tag, Before I leave for work, ...)
  - Gallery with hundreds of pre-build Shortcuts - also from 3rd party apps
  - 3rd party Shortcuts can provide outputs and thus be connected to other Shortcuts

- Let users discover Shortcut capabilities by showing the `Add to Siri` button at appropriate stages
- Redesigned `Add to Siri` sheet where users can enter the activation phrase and tweak the Shortcut parameters
- **Shortcut Customization**
  - In the **Intent Editor** you can 
    - Create Shortcuts your app offers to your users
    - Customize an intents parameters even with custom types (in iOS 13)
    - Control if parameters are exposed to the Shortcuts app

- **Parameter Resolution**
  - `Resolve` (prior `Confirm` and `Handle`) as newly added Shortcut lifecycle step
  - Siri goes through each parameter until it knows what to fill in for each
  - After resolution Siri invokes the same confirm and handle methods as in iOS 12
  - Resolution result can be: `.needsValue`, `.disambiguation`, `.unsupported`, `.confirmationRequired`, `.success`, `.notRequired`
    - User-facing message for each of them can be customized in intent editor

- **Related Parameters**
  - Express parameter relationships in the `Intent Editor > Section "Shortcuts App"`
  - Developers have to
    - Identify parent and child parameters
    - Establish parameter relationships
    - Update summaries for each parameter combination

- **Dynamic Options**
  - Check the Dynamic Options checkbox in Intent Editor
  - Provide the supported values and default values from delegate functions

- **Outputs**
  - Specify your own type that contains the properties you want to pass on to other actions 
  - Define a new property of your output type and designate it to be an output
