## watchOS 6

- Independent watchOS apps (decoupled from iOS apps)
- Extended run-time sessions
- Building experiences: Complications, Notifications, Siri, etc.
- Prioritize quick interactions


## Full Power of SwiftUI

- **Declarative syntax** Whole new UI framework, new fetures and APIs
- **Integration** Watchkit controllers with SwiftUI Views 
  - `InterfaceController` inherits `WKHostingController`

- **Lists** WatchOS flash cards app
- Keep model and List in sync using @ObservedObject
- Use `Command + Click` to bring up the inspector and use different contextual options while coding
- Use `.listStyle(.carousel)` to get the carousel effect while scrolling the list
- Swipe to delete, drag to reorder
- Use `.onMove` and `.onDelete` blocks to manage the movement and deletion of items in the list
- **Interactive Notifications** Timely and contextual info
  - Short look (Info from payload + App icon) Immediately upon wrist raise

- Long look (Scrolling interface with custom body and action buttons)
- `NotificationController` inherits `WKUserNotificationHostingController`
  - `didReceive` method allows us to extract info from notification
  - `body` property is re-evaluated after `didReceive` is called

- **Digital Crown** Series 4 watch can make use of haptic crown (e.g. workout app, custom timer)
  - Building following custom interfaces requires `.digitalCrowRotation` and `.focusable` modifier
  - Free scrolling interface (no concrete spots between elements)
  - binding (source of truth)
  - from
  - through

- Picking between discrete elements
  - binding (source of truth)
  - from
  - through
  - by (stride along which haptic feedback is provided)

- Moving around circles (not limited to either end of the sequence) 
  - binding (source of truth)
  - from
  - through
  - by (stride along which haptic feedback is provided)
  - sensitivity (how much rotation need to be applied to move from one element to the next)
  - isContinuous (don't stop at either limit of sequence)
