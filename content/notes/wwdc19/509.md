- **Presets** fine-tunes set of parameter values
- **Capture Snapshot** of state of Audio Unit's parameters
- Loading preset restores Audio Unit to same state
- `AUAudioUnit.factoryPresets` built into the unit by manufacturer. Immutable.
- `AUAudioUnit.userPresets` are new and are created by user. Mutable. Unit exposes them to all host applications.
- `supportsUserPreset: Bool` used to verify support by the host
- `saveUserPreset(_:)` & `deleteUserPreset(_:)`
- `presetState(for:) throws -> [String : Any]` to get state.
- `isLoadedInProcess: Bool` is a macOS only feature
- Methods above have default implementations. Can be overridden.
