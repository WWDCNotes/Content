- Supported on iPhone `XS, XS Max, XR, iPad Pro 3rd Gen`
- **AVCaptureMultiCamSession**
  - Multiple `AVCaptureDeiceInputs`, `AVCaptureDeiceOutputs` of the same type, `AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayers`
  - Don't use implicit connection forming but use `addInputWithNoConnections`, `addOutputWithNoConnections` or `AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer.setSessionWithNoConnection`

- **AVCaptureSession** is still the way to got for single cam session
  - Simultaneous photo shooting, movie recording, barcode scanning, etc.

- **Limitiations**
  - only one input per camera in a session 
  - connecting one camera to multiple video data outouts is not possible
  - no presets supported on session since different cams might run with different qualities
  - multi-cam session has `hardwareCost` reporting. Session runnable when `0 <= cost <= 1` 
  - lower cost by `lower resolution`, `choose binned format`, `deviceInput.videoMinFrameDurationOverride = CMTimeMake(1, 30) to set max framerate override /* 30 FPS */`
  - lower system pressure like `temperature, power demands, infrared projector temperature` by 
    - lowering frame rates, throttle GPU/CPU processing code, disable one camera

- 
  - run indefinitely with `multiSession.systemPressureCost < 1.0`; device shutdown with `cost > 3.0`
  - iOS can run only one session at a time (with mutli cams though)

-  **Virtual Camera** is the new name wor software cameras like `True-Tone- or Dual-Camera`
  - `device.isVirtualDevice` - get its physical devices by `device.constituentDevices` for e.g. synchronized camera streaming
  - `AVCaptureDataOutputSynchronizer` ensures you get two outputs in one callback
  - virtual devices have **secret ports** so you can get 2 streams - you need to explicitly query them

- **Dual Camera Hography Aids**
  - `CameraIntrinsics` (Optical center / focal length) and `CameraExtrinsics` (rotation matrix / translation vector for both wide- and tele cameras)

- **Multi-Microphone capture**
  - By default front cam uses `front mic` and back cam uses `back mic`
  - actually `front mic` and `back mic` are a lie since different devices have multiple mics but not explicitly fron/back ones. This is achieved by `Microphone Beam Forming` - done automatically by CoreAudio `micInput.ports(for: .audio, sourceDeviceType: micDevice.deviceType, sourceDevicePosition: .front).first`
  - Beam forming only works with built-in mics
  - audio can be arbitrarily configured by creating custom `AVAudioSession`
