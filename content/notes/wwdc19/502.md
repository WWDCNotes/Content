- Crucial for `Sports`, `Late-breaking news`, `Game Streaming`, `Award ceremonies`, ...
- 2-8 seconds is **gold standard** and matches cable/satellite TV
- HLS targets **1-2 seconds** delay
- **Regular HLS** 
  - Simple and robust BUT comes with a cost (20-30s behind live)
  - This comes due to [client - server roundtrips](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/502/?time=225) and [too much caching] (https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/502/?time=342)

- **Considerations**
  - HTTP is still king - but keeping it means keeping segment encode delay
  - CDNs are essentially to scale
  - Runway to react is much shorter

- **Changes**
  - **Reduce Publishing Latency** by allowing the server to publish small parts of the main segment before the main segment itself is ready
    - Leverage **Partial Segments**
    - Subset of regular segment - appear in parallel to them in playlist
    - Playlists update every partial segment
    - Publishing latency becomes the partial segment duration
    - Disappear quickly from playlist and are replaced/updated frequently

- 
  - **Optimize Segment Discovery** by allow asking for a particular playlist update in advance before it's actually ready on the server
    - Features enabled by **EXT-X-SERVER-CONTROL**
      - Small number of server directives 
      - Carried as query parameters on playlist URL (reserved in m3u8 URLs)
      - Sorted within URL to improve CDN hit ratio

- 
  - 
    - **Blocking Playlist Reload**
      - **EXT-X-SERVER-CONTROL** with **CAN-BLOCK-RELOAD** control
      - Clients ask for playlist update in advance
      - Server holds reuqest until next (partial) segment appears

- 
  - **Improve caching behavior** by allowing to have a different URL for each update
  - **Eleminate Segment Round Trip** by returning segments via push (HTTP/2) 
    - A playlist GET request also pushes new segment which eleminates additional rount trip

- 
  - **Reduce Playlist Transfer Overhead** by transmitting only delta updates if requested
    - Realized via `CAN-SKIP-UNTIL` control
    - Clients ask for delta updates explicitly
    - Update skips the earlier part of playlist

- 
  - **Switch Bitrate Tiers Quickly** by transmitting additional information with the updates
    - Playlist carry up-to-date reports on peer playlists
    - Last media sequence number and last partial segment number
    - Allows client to load latest playlist when switching bit rates

- **How Do Get Started?**
  - Deliver HLS via HTTP/2 and support **Push** + **Dependency and Weighting**
  - Each server must vend all bit rate tiers
  - CDN must aggregate duplicate pending requests to origin
  - Start implementing your origin - Spec for Low-Latency HLS is available now
  - During Beta period use App Entitlement `com.apple.developer.coremedia.hls.low-latency`
