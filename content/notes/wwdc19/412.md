## Thermal State Condition

- can set one of the following: fair, serious, critical.
- lets us analyze our app behavior in these states.
- The device does *not* actually get warmer.
- Useful if we observe and behave differently when we have different thermal states.
- We have a new thermal state in the Debug Navigator. 
- To override this setting we must go in the Device and Simulator window, choose a device and then we can set the condition:
![][conditionImage]
- In the device itself we will see the condition in the background filler around the time (like we see now when we have an active call, also called status bar indicator)
- To stop the condition we can: 
  - quit Xcode 
  - disconnect the device
  - Go back in the Device & window
  - Tap on the status bar indicator

## Network Link Condition

Updated with new range of options, same as above.

## Environment Overrides

![][envImage]

You can change things like:

- Interface appearance
- Dynamic Type
- And Accessibility Options

You can use them both while Debugging the simulator or while debugging a SwiftUI live view. 

## New Run Time Issue Breakpoint

![][runImage]

## Debugging SwiftUI Live Previews

- `Control`+`click` on the play button to choose to debug a preview, then it behaves like a normal debug session.
- Do not change the window where the previewed view is, or the debugging session will disappear instantly.

##￼SwiftUI Runtime Issues

- Equivalent to auto layout issues or when we try to change our UI from a background thread, they point out issues of our SwiftUI usage.
- These are shown even when debugging SwiftUI Live Previews, in fact the live preview is a mini-app where we only focus on that view. 
(Every change **builds** and **runs** that view, it’s not really "live")

You can also refresh a SwiftUI preview via shortcut `⌥⌘P`.

## UI Debugger Enhancements

- `CustomReflectable` Protocol
- Use this protocol in your view to show the data you need while debugging in the UI Debugger Inspector
![][debugImage]
- Trait Collections in the UI Debugger
![][traitImage]
- Named Assets: For image views, we get image name and other info if it’s a symbol image:
![][assetsImage]
The same for colors, now we get the color name displayed .
- Constraints: the constraints view in UI Debugger also look much better and similar to interface builder:
