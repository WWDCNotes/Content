## `UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout`

With iOS 13 we have a new class `UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout`.

As the name says, its main property is that it is **composable**:  
we have items (think cells) that go inside groups, that go inside sections, that go inside the layout.

Every element (Item/group/section) has an explicit size of type [`NSCollectionLayoutDimension`][dimensionDoc], we can have:

- Fractional size: we can say width 25% of its container
- Absolute size: give an exact number
- Estimated: we can just give an estimate and this is flexible

Every element defines it size to referring to its container: if an item says it’s 50% width of its container (group), and the group is 50% of screen width, this means that our item will be 25% of the screen width

We can consider an Item as “_a thing that renders on screen_”, a cell.

We have three forms of [Group][groupDoc] ([`NSCollectionLayoutGroup`][groupDoc]): 

- Vertical (axis)
- Horizontal (axis)
- Custom: lets you specify everything.

A group represent some kind of repeating structure the collection is going to have. 
A column of lists for example.

Lastly the section, `NSCollectionLayoutSection`, defines the layout definition of one section, which means each section can have crazy different layouts.

Since Items are just a concept that we have to fill in, we can now have different types of items (per section!), such us headers, footers, and more.

With `UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout` we can anchor things on an item or at the top/bottom of a section.

We can have nested groups.

The new `UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout` enables to do crazy things that previously would have required tons of custom code/behaviour: no longer.

An example of adoption of this layout class is the App Store home screen, which is now a single collection view controller:
