## Dark Mode

  - Add `:root { color-scheme: light dark; ... }` to tell WebKit that the entire page supports dark mode
  - Adapting custom CSS styles with `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) { ... }`
  - Adapting images using `<picture><source srcset="dark.jpg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"> <img src="light.jpg"></picture>`
  - Adapting dynamic content via the JS **match media API**

## WebShare

  - Native share sheet from within web content
  - Uses all the improvements made in iOS 13 to the native share sheet
  - Add `await navigator.share({title: "", text: "", url: ""})` to e.g. a buttons event listener

## New Media Features

  - Checking the device's capabilities using the new **Media Capability API**
  - Support for **Alpha Channel Video** (ACV) in iOS 13 and macOS Catalina
    - Make sure that ACV is available on underlying device by adding an alpha channel key to capability object: `alphaChannel: true`
    - Check via `if(capabilities.supported && capabilities.supportedConfiguration.video.alphaChannel) {} else {}`

## WebRTC Screen Capture

  - Prompt the user for permission via `navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia({ video: true }).then((stream) => {...}`
  - `stream` contains capture of the space containing the Safari window
  - Can be used to share your screen

## Tools for Improving Performance

  - Web Inspector adds a new **CPU Timeline** packed with actionable information
  - There is a post on the WebKit blog and a WWDC session video called [Understanding CPU Usage with Web Inspector][wwdc19513]
  - WebDriver on iOS for automation and regression testing

## Storing Structured Data

  - Added IndexedDB and completely removed WebSQL in Safari 13
  - All modern browsers support `IndexedDB`
  - Transition as asap

## Apple Pay

- Fully supported using the **Payment Request API**
- Use Apple Pay in `WKWebView` on iOS 13
  - Denied if script has ever been injected
  - Future script injections denied if Apple Pay ever requested
  - Restrictions are reset during navigation

- `canMakePayments` must be called before showing an Apple Pay button or doing anything using Apple Pay
- Prefer WebKit APIs instead of using JS when possible
