## XCFramework

- A XCFramework is multiple binary frameworks in one package.

- You can bundle: 
  - a variant of the framework for each target (iPhones, Simulators).
  - a variant of the same framework for different platforms:
  ![][platformImage]

- We can also have variants with different dependencies as well:
![][depImage]

- XCFrameworks support both Swift and “c-based” code.

## How do XCFrameworks work?

Like another binary, but the header is a new Swift Module Interfaces type, which, kind of like the `Package.swift` file for SPM packages, contains information on the required compiler version and a full list of public classes and methods available from within the framework.

## How to create a XCFrameworks

- We have a new setting:
![][buildImage]

- In order to release a binary we need to archive the framework (a.k.a. build in release mode) and the output will be available in the organizer.

- The default path is:
![][pathImage]

￼
- We can change the output path in Xcode Locations from the preferences window.

- After archiving different frameworks we can create a final `.xcframework` by using the command line:
![][cliImage]
