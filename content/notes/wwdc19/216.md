## Views

- Basic building blocks of user interfaces.
- Define a piece of UI
- Prefer smaller, single-purpose view
- The entire SwiftUI framework is oriented around composition of small pieces: organize the code in the same way
- Each view is a `Struct`,therefore not inheriting anything
- Each view defines a small piece of UI, it doesn’t have to take care of everything
- Views are **not** persistent objects that we update over time using imperative event-based code.
- Views are defined declaratively as a function of their inputs.

## Container Views

- Container views are declared as a composition of other views serving as their content.
- Those Content views are declared within a special kind of closure known as a [@ViewBuilder][vbDoc].

For example, use the [`Form`][FormDoc] container  to make things look like a normal settings screen

## $bindings

- We use the leading dollar sign prefix to indicate that we should pass a binding in our state instead of just passing a read-only value. 
- A binding is a kind of managed reference that allows one view to edit the state of another view.

## Primitive Views

- [`Text`][TextRoc]
- [`Image`][ImageDoc]
- [`Color`][ColorDoc]
- [`Shape`][ShapeDoc]
- [`Spacer`][SpacerDoc]
- [`Divider`][DividerDoc]

## Controls

- Describe purpose, not visuals
- Adaptive and reusable 
- Customizable
- Accessible out of the box

## `@environment` property

- Connected to the environment value. 
- We can use its value just like any other property. 
- The environment is a great encapsulation for pushing data down through the view hierarchy.
