## Protecting System Software

- System integrity protection to prevent file system (FS) modification by malicious software
- System FS will now be read-only
- Connection between read-only and read-write FS by **Firmlinks**
- **Firmlinks**
  - Consistent forward and backward traversal of the file name space
  - For directories only
  - Created on the system volume on installation time
  - Neither expected to be noticed by any user nor application

- Read-only state can be disabled temporarily until after a reboot

## Apple Software Restore (ASR), Volume Replication and Snapshots

- Intention is to copy whole volume content including metadata which is superior to file-only copy
- Usable by Enterprise/Education, IT to setup labs and/or backup utilities
- New: APFS volume replication with ASR
  - Decryption / Encryption is no part of generation / restore process (on-the-fly defragmentation)
  - Restore and erase target volume: `sudo asr restore --source file.dmg --target /Volumes/Volume2 --erase`
  - Restore to newly created target volume: `sudo asr restore --source file.dmg --target /dev/disk1`
  - Restore with snapshots: `sudo asr restore --source file.dmg --target /Volumes/Target --toSnapshot Snap1`
  - Restore snapshot delta: `sudo asr restore --source file.dmg --target /Volumes/Target --fromSnapshot Snap1 --toSnapshot Snap2`

## External File Access on iOS

- Access files from network (SMB 3.0) and USB (unencrypted APFS, unencrypted HFS Plus, FAT, ExFAT) sources
- For security reasons all FS manipulations happen in dedicate process space, not in kernel
- Pay attention to volume capabilities (case sensitivity, ...)
- File movement may take time now
- External devices can disappear
