## Launch phases

1. System InterfaceSeparate in two phases:
  - DYLD3Dynamic Linker: loads shared libraries and frameworks
  - libSystem Init: initializes app low level components

2. Static Runtime init
  - Separate in two phases:
    - Initializes the language runtime (objc/swift)
    - Expose dedicate initialization API in frameworks.
    - Reduce impact to launch by avoiding `+[Class load]`
    - Use `[Class initialize]` to lazily conduct static initialization

3. UIKit init
  - This is when the system initializes `UIApplication` and `UIApplicationDelegate`

4. Application init
  - Invokes `UIApplicationDelegate` app lifecycle callbacks `UIApplicationWillFinishLaunching` / `didFinish` / `DidBecomeActive`
  - (iOS 13 and later) We now get UISceneDelegate UI lifecycle callbacks for each scene: `willConnectToSession:`, `sceneWillEnterForeground:`, `sceneDidBecomeActive`.

5. Initial Frame Render
  - this is when the app views are created, their layout is performed, and they’re drawn. `loadView` `viewDidLoad` `layoutSubviews`
  - tips:
    - reduce the number of views launched at the beginning
    - flat view hierarchies and lazily load views not needed during launch

6. Extended
  - apps specific logic

## How to test our app launch time

We have an instrument entirely dedicated to analyze launch times: this will split the app launch in all the sections seen above and highlight our code that executes during this phase.

The new XCTest Metrics is also a very useful and lightweight way to make sure to not incur in some huge slowdowns during development.
