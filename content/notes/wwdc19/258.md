In the new scene delegate based lifecycle:

- app delegate should still handle things like initializing/cleaning up the whole process
- it should not however handle things like setting up the UI or updating it when the app goes into foreground/background - because this will now happen separately per session
- additionally, application delegate is now notified when a scene is created or discarded
- lifecycle delegate methods like [`applicationWillEnterForeground`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/1623076-applicationwillenterforeground), [`applicationDidBecomeActive`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/1622956-applicationdidbecomeactive) etc. will not be called at all if scene lifecycle is enabled

## Modern lifecycle flow

Starting the app:

- `AppDelegate`: [`didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/1622921-application)
- `AppDelegate`: [`_:configurationForConnecting:options:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/3197905-application) `->` [`UISceneConfiguration`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uisceneconfiguration) - return configuration for the scene
- `SceneDelegate`: [`_:willConnectTo:options:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscenedelegate/3197914-scene) - this is where you set up your new scene

Scene configuration ([`UISceneConfiguration`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uisceneconfiguration)): an object that describes the delegate class, storyboard etc. It's either built dynamically, or (better) statically described in `Info.plist` and looked up by name using the constructor:

```swift
UISceneConfiguration(name: "Default", sessionRole: session.role)
```

Going to the background:

- `SceneDelegate`: [`sceneWillResignActive`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscenedelegate/3197919-scenewillresignactive)
- `SceneDelegate`: [`sceneDidEnterBackground`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscenedelegate/3197917-scenedidenterbackground)
- …
- `SceneDelegate`: [`sceneDidDisconnect`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscenedelegate/3197916-scenediddisconnect) - after some time, the system will release your scene (including the delegate object and all views and VCs) to save memory; you should now release any objects loaded to build that piece of UI

When the user force-closes a scene:

- `AppDelegate`: [`_:didDiscardSceneSessions:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/3197906-application) (may be called on the next launch instead)

> *“State restoration is no longer a nicety”*

Watch out for cases where a view controller needs to be updated if there are multiple scenes presenting the same view, which you might not have taken into account before - it’s better to only update the model and observe changes in the model, instead of updating the view directly when the user adds some new content.

- pro tip: you can pass Swift-only objects like enums in [`NSNotification`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsnotification) if you use them as the sending object instead of in `userInfo`
